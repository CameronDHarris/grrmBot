among them, nervous with excitement. this was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king's justice done. it was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of bran's life.\\n\\n\\nthe man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. robb thought he was a wildli\", \"ng, his sword sworn to mance rayder, the king-beyond-the-wall. it made bran's skin prickle to think of it. he remembered the hearth tales old nan told them. the wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. they consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. and their women lay with the others in the long night to sire terrible half-human children.\\n\\n\\nbut the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast\", \" wall awaiting the king's justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than robb. he had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the night's watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.\\n\\n\\nthe breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. robb and jon sat tall and still on their horses, with bran between them on his pony, trying to seem\", \" older than seven, trying to pretend that he'd seen all this before. a faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. over their heads flapped the banner of the starks of winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.\\n\\n\\nbran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. his closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. he had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit \", \"before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. he had taken off father's face, bran thought, and donned the face of lord stark of winterfell.\\n\\n\\nthere were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward bran could not recall much of what had been said. finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. they forced his head dow\", 'n onto the hard black wood. lord eddard stark dismounted and his ward theon greyjoy brought forth the sword. \"ice,\" that sword was called. it was as wide across as a man\\'s hand, and taller even than robb. the blade was valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. nothing held an edge like valyrian steel.\\n\\n\\nhis father peeled off his gloves and handed them to jory cassel, the captain of his household guard. he took hold of ice with both hands and said, \"in the name of robert of the house barath', 'eon, the first of his name, king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men, lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm, by the word of eddard of the house stark, lord of winterfell and warden of the north, i do sentence you to die.\" he lifted the greatsword high above his head.\\n\\n\\nbran\\'s bastard brother jon snow moved closer. \"keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"and don\\'t look away. father will know if you do.\"\\n\\n\\nbran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.\\n\\n\\nh', \"is father took off the man's head with a single sure stroke. blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. one of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. bran could not take his eyes off the blood. the snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.\\n\\n\\nthe head bounced off a thick root and rolled. it came up near greyjoy's feet. theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. he laughed, put his boot on the head, and ki\", 'cked it away.\\n\\n\\n\"ass,\" jon muttered, low enough so greyjoy did not hear. he put a hand on bran\\'s shoulder, and bran looked over at his bastard brother. \"you did well,\" jon told him solemnly. jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.\\n\\n\\nit seemed colder on the long ride back to winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.\\n\\n\\n\"the deserter died bravely,', '\" robb said. he was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\\'s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the tullys of riverrun. \"he had courage, at the least.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" jon snow said quietly. \"it was not courage. this one was dead of fear. you could see it in his eyes, stark.\" jon\\'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. he was of an age with robb, but they did not look alike. jon was slender where robb was muscular, ', 'dark where robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.\\n\\n\\nrobb was not impressed. \"the others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"he died well. race you to the bridge?\"\\n\\n\\n\"done,\" jon said, kicking his horse forward. robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, robb laughing and hooting, jon silent and intent. the hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.\\n\\n\\nbran did not try to follow. his pony could not keep up. he had seen the ragge', 'd man\\'s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. after a while, the sound of robb\\'s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.\\n\\n\\nso deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. \"are you well, bran?\" he asked, not unkindly.\\n\\n\\n\"yes, father,\" bran told him. he looked up. wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"robb says the man died bravely, but jon says he', ' was afraid.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what do you think?\" his father asked.\\n\\n\\nbran thought about it. \"can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\"\\n\\n\\n\"that is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"do you understand why i did it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"he was a wildling,\" bran said. \"they carry off women and sell them to the others.\"\\n\\n\\nhis lord father smiled. \"old nan has been telling you stories again. in truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the night\\'s watch. no man is more dangerous. the deserter knows h', 'is life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. but you mistake me. the question was not why the man had to die, but why i must do it.\"\\n\\n\\nbran had no answer for that. \"king robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n\"he does,\" his father admitted. \"as did the targaryen kings before him. yet our way is the older way. the blood of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence sh', 'ould swing the sword. if you would take a man\\'s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. and if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.\\n\\n\\n\"one day, bran, you will be robb\\'s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. when that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. a ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.', '\"\\n\\n\\nthat was when jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. he waved and shouted down at them. \"father, bran, come quickly, see what robb has found!\" then he was gone again.\\n\\n\\njory rode up beside them. \"trouble, my lord?\"\\n\\n\\n\"beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" he sent his horse into a trot. jory and bran and the rest came after.\\n\\n\\nthey found robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with jon still mounted beside him. th', 'e late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. he was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.\\n\\n\\nthe riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground . jory cassel and theon greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. bran heard the breath go out of him. \"gods!\" he exclaime', 'd, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.\\n\\n\\njory\\'s sword was already out. \"robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him.\\n\\n\\nrobb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"she can\\'t hurt you,\" he said. \"she\\'s dead, jory.\"\\n\\n\\nbran was afire with curiosity by then. he would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. bran jumped off and ran.\\n\\n\\nby then jon, jory, and theon greyjoy ha', 'd all dismounted as well. \"what in the seven hells is it?\" greyjoy was saying.\\n\\n\\n\"a wolf,\" robb told him.\\n\\n\\n\"a freak,\" greyjoy said. \"look at the size of it.\"\\n\\n\\nbran\\'s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers\\' side.\\n\\n\\nhalf-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\\'s perfume. bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide m', 'outh full of yellowed teeth. but it was the size of it that made him gasp. it was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\\'s kennel.\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s no freak,\" jon said calmly. \"that\\'s a direwolf. they grow larger than the other kind.\"\\n\\n\\ntheon greyjoy said, \"there\\'s not been a direwolf sighted south of the wall in two hundred years.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i see one now,\" jon replied.\\n\\n\\nbran tore his eyes away from the monster. that was when he noticed the bundle in robb\\'s arms. he gave a cry', ' of delight and moved closer. the pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. it nuzzled blindly against robb\\'s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. bran reached out hesitantly. \"go on,\" robb told him. \"you can touch him.\"\\n\\n\\nbran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as jon said, \"here you go.\" his half brother put a second pup into his arms. \"there are five of them.\" bran sat down in the snow and hugged t', 'he wolf pup to his face. its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.\\n\\n\\n\"direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered hullen, the master of horse. \"i like it not.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it is a sign,\" jory said.\\n\\n\\nfather frowned. \"this is only a dead animal, jory,\" he said. yet he seemed troubled. snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. \"do we know what killed her?\"\\n\\n\\n\"there\\'s something in the throat,\" robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. \"', 'there, just under the jaw.\"\\n\\n\\nhis father knelt and groped under the beast\\'s head with his hand. he gave a yank and held it up for all to see. a foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.\\n\\n\\na sudden silence descended over the party. the men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. even bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.\\n\\n\\nhis father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"i\\'m surprised she lived long enough ', 'to whelp,\" he said. his voice broke the spell.\\n\\n\\n\"maybe she didn\\'t,\" jory said. \"i\\'ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.\"\\n\\n\\n\"born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"worse luck.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no matter,\" said hullen. \"they be dead soon enough too.\"\\n\\n\\nbran gave a wordless cry of dismay.\\n\\n\\n\"the sooner the better,\" theon greyjoy agreed. he drew his sword. \"give the beast here, bran.\"\\n\\n\\nthe little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"no!\" bran cried ', 'out fiercely. \"it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\"put away your sword, greyjoy,\" robb said. for a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. \"we will keep these pups.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you cannot do that, boy,\" said harwin, who was hullen\\'s son.\\n\\n\\n\"it be a mercy to kill them,\" hullen said.\\n\\n\\nbran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"hullen speaks truly, son. better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no!\" he could feel tears', ' welling in his eyes, and he looked away. he did not want to cry in front of his father.\\n\\n\\nrobb resisted stubbornly. \"ser rodrik\\'s red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"it was a small litter, only two live pups. she\\'ll have milk enough.\"\\n\\n\\n\"she\\'ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\"\\n\\n\\n\"lord stark,\" jon said. it was strange to hear him call father that, so formal. bran looked at him with desperate hope. \"there are five pups,\" he told father. \"three male, two female.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what of it, jo', 'n?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you have five trueborn children,\" jon said. \"three sons, two daughters. the direwolf is the sigil of your house. your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\"\\n\\n\\nbran saw his father\\'s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. he loved jon with all his heart at that moment. even at seven, bran understood what his brother had done. the count had come right only because jon had omitted himself. he had included the girls, included even rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who ', 'bore the surname snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.\\n\\n\\ntheir father understood as well. \"you want no pup for yourself, jon?\" he asked softly.\\n\\n\\n\"the direwolf graces the banners of house stark,\" jon pointed out. \"i am no stark, father.\"\\n\\n\\ntheir lord father regarded jon thoughtfully. robb rushed into the silence he left. \"i will nurse him myself, father,\" he promised. \"i will soak a towel with warm milk, and giv', 'e him suck from that.\"\\n\\n\\n\"me too!\" bran echoed.\\n\\n\\nthe lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"easy to say, and harder to do. i will not have you wasting the servants\\' time with this. if you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. is that understood?\"\\n\\n\\nbran nodded eagerly. the pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.\\n\\n\\n\"you must train them as well,\" their father said. \"you must train them. the kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monst', 'ers, i promise you that. and the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. these are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. a direwolf will rip a man\\'s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. are you sure you want this?\"\\n\\n\"yes, father,\" bran said.\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" robb agreed.\\n\\n\\n\"the pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\"\\n\\n\\n\"they won\\'t die,\" robb said. \"we won\\'t let them die.\"\\n\\n\\n\"keep them, then. jory, desmond, gather up the other pups. i', 't\\'s time we were back to winterfell.\"\\n\\n\\nit was not until they were mounted and on their way that bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. by then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. bran was wondering what to name him.\\n\\n\\nhalfway across the bridge, jon pulled up suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\"what is it, jon?\" their lord father asked.\\n\\n\\n\"can\\'t you hear it?\"\\n\\n\\nbran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood plank', 's, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but jon was listening to something else.\\n\\n\\n\"there,\" jon said. he swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. they watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. a moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.\\n\\n\\n\"he must have crawled away from the others,\" jon said.\\n\\n\\n\"or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. his fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. his eyes were a', 's red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.\\n\\n\\n\"an albino,\" theon greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"this one will die even faster than the others.\"\\n\\n\\njon snow gave his father\\'s ward a long, chilling look. \"i think not, greyjoy,\" he said. \"this one belongs to me.\" \\n\\n\\ncatelyn\\n\\n\\ncatelyn had never liked this godswood.\\n\\n\\nshe had been born a tully, at riverrun far to the south, ', 'on the red fork of the trident. the godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers.\\n\\n\\nthe gods of winterfell kept a different sort of wood. it was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. it smelled of moist earth and decay. no redwoods grew here. this was a wood of stubborn se', \"ntinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. this was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names.\\n\\n\\nbut she knew she would find her husband here tonight. whenever he took a man's life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn had bee\", 'n anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of riverrun. she was of the faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. the tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. w', 'orship was for the sept.\\n\\n\\nfor her sake, ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the first men still flowed in the veins of the starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.\\n\\n\\nat the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. \"the heart tree,\" ned called it. the weirwood\\'s bark was white a', \"s bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. a face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. they were old, those eyes; older than winterfell itself. they had seen brandon the builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; they had watched the castle's granite walls rise around them. it was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during th\", 'e dawn centuries before the coming of the first men across the narrow sea.\\n\\n\\nin the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the isle of faces where the green men kept their silent watch. up here it was different. here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. the greatsword ice was across his lap, and he was ', 'cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. a thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \"ned,\" she called softly.\\n\\n\\nhe lifted his head to look at her. \"catelyn,\" he said. his voice was distant and formal. \"where are the children?\"\\n\\n\\nhe would always ask her that. \"in the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\" she spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside', ' the pool, her back to the weirwood. she could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \"arya is already in love, and sansa is charmed and gracious, but rickon is not quite sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\"is he afraid?\" ned asked.\\n\\n\\n\"a little,\" she admitted. \"he is only three.\"\\n\\n\\nned frowned. \"he must learn to face his fears. he will not be three forever. and winter is coming.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" catelyn agreed. the words gave her a chill, as they always did. the stark words. every noble house had its w', 'ords. family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. all but the starks. winter is coming, said the stark words. not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were.\\n\\n\\n\"the man died well, i\\'ll give him that,\" ned said. he had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. he ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \"i was glad for bran\\'s sake. y', 'ou would have been proud of bran.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i am always proud of bran,\" catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. she could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that ice had its own beauty. it had been forged in valyria, before the doom had come to the old freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. four hundred ye', 'ars old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged. the name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the starks were kings in the north.\\n\\n\\n\"he was the fourth this year,\" ned said grimly. \"the poor man was half-mad. something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.\" he sighed. \"ben writes that the strength of the night\\'s watch is down below a thousand. it\\'s not only desertions. they are losing men on rangings as well.\"\\n\\n\\n\"is it the wildlings?\" sh', 'e asked .\\n\\n\\n\"who else?\" ned lifted ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \"and it will only grow worse. the day may come when i will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this king-beyond-the-wall for good and all.\"\\n\\n\\n\"beyond the wall?\" the thought made catelyn shudder.\\n\\n\\nned saw the dread on her face. \"mance rayder is nothing for us to fear.\"\\n\\n\\n\"there are darker things beyond the wall.\" she glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, wat', 'ching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.\\n\\n\\nhis smile was gentle. \"you listen to too many of old nan\\'s stories. the others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. maester luwin will tell you they never lived at all. no living man has ever seen one.\"\\n\\n\\n\"until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\" catelyn reminded him.\\n\\n\\n\"i ought to know better than to argue with a tully,\" he said with a rueful smile. he slid ice back into its sheath. ', '\"you did not come here to tell me crib tales. i know how little you like this place. what is it, my lady?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn took her husband\\'s hand. \"there was grievous news today, my lord. i did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself.\" there was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. \"i am so sorry, my love. jon arryn is dead.\"\\n\\n\\nhis eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. in his youth, ned had fostered at the eyrie, and the ch', 'ildless lord arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, robert baratheon. when the mad king aerys ii targaryen had demanded their heads, the lord of the eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.\\n\\n\\nand one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and ned stood together in the sept at riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of lord hoster tully.\\n\\n\\n\"jon . . . \" he said. \"is th', 'is news certain?\"\\n\\n\\n\"it was the king\\'s seal, and the letter is in robert\\'s own hand. i saved it for you. he said lord arryn was taken quickly. even maester pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so jon did not linger long in pain.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that is some small mercy, i suppose,\" he said. she could see the grief on his face, but even then he thought first of her. \"your sister,\" he said. \"and jon\\'s boy. what word of them?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the message said only that they were well, and had returne', 'd to the eyrie,\" catelyn said. \"i wish they had gone to riverrun instead. the eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband\\'s place, not hers. lord jon\\'s memory will haunt each stone. i know my sister. she needs the comfort of family and friends around her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"your uncle waits in the vale, does he not? jon named him knight of the gate, i\\'d heard.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn nodded. \"brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. that is some comfort, but still . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"go to her,\" ned urged. \"t', 'ake the children. fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. that boy of hers needs other children about him, and lysa should not be alone in her grief.\"\\n\\n\\n\"would that i could,\" catelyn said. \"the letter had other tidings. the king is riding to winterfell to seek you out.\"\\n\\n\\nit took ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \"robert is coming here?\" when she nodded, a smile broke across his face.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn wished she could share his', ' joy. but she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \"i knew that would please you,\" she said. \"we should send word to your brother on the wall.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes, of course,\" he agreed. \"ben will want to be here. i shall tell maester luwin to send his swiftest bird.\" ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \"damnation, how many ', 'years has it been? and he gives us no more notice than this? how many in his party, did the message say?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. cersei and the children travel with them.\"\\n\\n\\n\"robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\" he said. \"it is just as well. that will give us more time to prepare.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the queen\\'s brothers are also in the party,\" she told him.\\n\\n\\nned grimaced at that. there was small love between hi', 'm and the queen\\'s family, catelyn knew. the lannisters of casterly rock had come late to robert\\'s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. \"well, if the price for robert\\'s company is an infestation of lannisters, so be it. it sounds as though robert is bringing half his court.\"\\n\\n\\n\"where the king goes, the realm follows,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n\"it will be good to see the children. the youngest was still sucking at the lannister woman\\'s teat the last time i saw him. he must b', 'e, what, five by now?\"\\n\\n\\n\"prince tommen is seven,\" she told him. \"the same age as bran. please, ned, guard your tongue. the lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\"\\n\\n\\nned squeezed her hand. \"there must be a feast, of course, with singers, and robert will want to hunt. i shall send jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. gods, how are we going to feed them all? on his way already, you said? damn the man. damn ', 'his royal hide.\"\\n\\n\\ndaenerys\\n\\n\\nher brother held the gown up for her inspection. \"this is beauty. touch it. go on. caress the fabric.\"\\n\\n\\ndany touched it. the cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. she could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. it frightened her. she pulled her hand away. \"is it really mine?\"\\n\\n\\n\"a gift from the magister illyrio,\" viserys said, smiling. her brother was in a high mood tonight. \"the color will bring out the violet in your eyes', '. and you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. illyrio has promised. tonight you must look like a princess.\"\\n\\n\\na princess, dany thought. she had forgotten what that was like. perhaps she had never really known. \"why does he give us so much?\" she asked. \"what does he want from us?\" for nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister\\'s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in th', 'e free city of pentos.\\n\\n\\n\"illyrio is no fool,\" viserys said. he was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. \"the magister knows that i will not forget my friends when i come into my throne.\"\\n\\n\\ndany said nothing. magister illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. he had friends in all of the nine free cities, it was said, and even beyond, in vaes dothrak and the fabled lands beside the jadesea. it was also said t', 'hat he\\'d never had a friend he wouldn\\'t cheerfully sell for the right price. dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. his anger was a terrible thing when roused. viserys called it \"waking the dragon.\"\\n\\n\\nher brother hung the gown beside the door. \"illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. be sure you wash off the stink of the stables. khal drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks fo', 'r a different sort of mount.\" he studied her critically. \"you still slouch. straighten yourself\" he pushed back her shoulders with his hands. \"let them see that you have a woman\\'s shape now.\" his fingers brushed lightly over her budding br**sts and tightened on a nipple. \"you will not fail me tonight. if you do, it will go hard for you. you don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" his fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. \"do you?\" he repeated.\\n\\n\"no,\" ', 'dany said meekly.\\n\\n\\nher brother smiled. \"good.\" he touched her hair, almost with affection. \"when they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\"\\n\\n\\nwhen he was gone, dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. the square brick towers of pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games bey', \"ond the walls of the estate. for a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at khal drogo's manse.\\n\\n\\nsomewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. the dothraki called tha\", 't land rhaesh andahli, the land of the andals. in the free cities, they talked of westeros and the sunsetkingdoms. her brother had a simpler name. \"our land,\" he called it. the words were like a prayer with him. if he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \"ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. you do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. the dragon remembers.\"\\n\\n\\nand perhaps the dragon did remember, but dany could not. she had never seen this land her', \" brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. these places he talked of, casterly rock and the eyrie, highgarden and the vale of arryn, dorne and the isle of faces, they were just words to her. viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled king's landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper, but daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother's womb.\\n\\n\\nyet sometimes dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. the midnight fli\", \"ght to dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails. her brother rhaegar battling the usurper in the bloody waters of the trident and dying for the woman he loved. the sack of king's landing by the ones viserys called the usurper's dogs, the lords lannister and stark. princess elia of dorne pleading for mercy as rhaegar's heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. the polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room \", \"while the kingslayer opened father's throat with a golden sword.\\n\\n\\nshe had been born on dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. they said that storm was terrible. the targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother viserys had never forgiven her.\\n\\n\\nsh\", \"e did not remember dragonstone either. they had run again, just before the usurper's brother set sail with his new-built fleet. by then only dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their house, had remained of the seven kingdoms that had once been theirs. it would not remain for long. the garrison had been prepared to sell them to the usurper, but one night ser willem darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of \", 'darkness for the safety of the braavosian coast.\\n\\n\\nshe remembered ser willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. the servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to dany. he called her \"little princess\" and sometimes \"my lady,\" and his hands were soft as old leather. he never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. that was when they lived in braavos,', \" in the big house with the red door. dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. after ser willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.\\n\\n\\nthey had wandered since then, from braavos to myr, from myr to tyrosh, and on to qohor and volantis and lys, never staying long in any one place. her brother would not allow it. the usurper's hi\", \"red knives were close behind them, he insisted, though dany had never seen one.\\n\\n\\nat first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the usurper continued to sit upon the iron throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from mother's crown had gone. in the alleys and wine sinks of pent\", 'os, they called her brother \"the beggar king.\" dany did not want to know what they called her.\\n\\n\\n\"we will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\" he would promise her. sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. \"the jewels and the silks, dragonstone and king\\'s landing, the iron throne and the sevenkingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\" viserys lived for that day. all that daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, ', 'the childhood she had never known.\\n\\n\\nthere came a soft knock on her door. \"come,\" dany said, turning away from the window. illyrio\\'s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. they were slaves, a gift from one of the magister\\'s many dothraki friends. there was no slavery in the free city of pentos. nonetheless, they were slaves. the old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. she was illyrio\\'s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixte', 'en who chattered constantly as she worked.\\n\\n\\nthey filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. the girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over dany\\'s head and helped her into the tub. the water was scalding hot, but daenerys did not flinch or cry out. she liked the heat. it made her feel clean. besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a targaryen. \"ours is the house of the dragon,\" he would say. \"the fire is in our blood.\"', '\\n\\n\\nthe old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. the girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \"drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. a hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in vaes dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\" there was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount', ' a horse, a demon archer. daenerys said nothing. she had always assumed that she would wed viserys when she came of age. for centuries the targaryens had married brother to sister, since aegon the conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. the line must be kept pure, viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old valyria, the blood of the dragon. dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of les', 'ser men. yet now viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian.\\n\\n\\nwhen she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. the girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. they dressed her in the wisps that magister illyrio had sent up, and ', 'then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. the girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient valyrian glyphs.\\n\\n\\n\"now you look all a princess,\" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that illyrio had so thoughtfully provid', 'ed. a princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how khal drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. she felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.\\n\\n\\nher brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. he rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \"stand there,\" he told her. \"turn around. yes. good. you look . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"regal,\" magister illyrio said, stepping through a', 'n archway. he moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man . beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. \"may the lord of light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, princess daenerys,\" the magister said as he took her hand. he bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. \"s', 'he is a vision, your grace, a vision,\" he told her brother. \"drogo will be enraptured.\"\\n\\n\\n\"she\\'s too skinny,\" viserys said. his hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. it was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. he rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that illyrio had lent him, and said, \"are you sure that khal drogo likes his women this young?\"\\n\\n\\n\"she has had her blood. she is old en', 'ough for the khal,\" illyrio told him, not for the first time. \"look at her. that silver-gold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our drogo.\" when he released her hand, daenerys found herself trembling.\\n\\n\\n\"i suppose,\" her brother said doubtfully. \"the savages have queer tastes. boys, horses, sheep . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"best not suggest this to khal drogo,\" illyrio said.\\n', '\\n\\nanger flashed in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. \"do you take me for a fool?\"\\n\\n\\nthe magister bowed slightly. \"i take you for a king. kings lack the caution of common men. my apologies if i have given offense.\" he turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers.\\n\\n\\nthe streets of pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in illyrio\\'s elaborately carved palanquin. two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted th', 'e poles to their shoulders. it was warm and close inside behind the curtains. dany could smell the stench of illyrio\\'s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.\\n\\n\\nher brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. his mind was away across the narrow sea. \"we won\\'t need his whole khalasar,\" viserys said. his fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \"ten thousand, that would be enough, i could sweep the seven kingdoms', ' with ten thousand dothraki screamers. the realm will rise for its rightful king. tyrell, redwyne, darry, greyjoy, they have no more love for the usurper than i do. the dornishmen burn to avenge elia and her children. and the smallfolk will be with us. they cry out for their king.\" he looked at illyrio anxiously. \"they do, don\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n\"they are your people, and they love you well,\" magister illyrio said amiably. \"in holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while w', 'omen sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.\" he gave a massive shrug. \"or so my agents tell me.\"\\n\\n\\ndany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted illyrio\\'s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about illyrio. her brother was nodding eagerly, however. \"i shall kill the usurper myself,\" he promised, who had never killed anyone, \"as he killed my brother rhaegar. and lannister too, t', 'he kingslayer, for what he did to my father.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that would be most fitting,\" magister illyrio said. dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips, but her brother did not notice. nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and dany knew he was fighting the battle of the trident once again.\\n\\n\\nthe nine-towered manse of khal drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy. it had been given to the khal by the magisters ', 'of pentos, illyrio told them. the free cities were always generous with the horselords. \"it is not that we fear these barbarians,\" illyrio would explain with a smile. \"the lord of light would hold our city walls against a million dothraki, or so the red priests promise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\"\\n\\n\\ntheir palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. he had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a dothraki, ', 'but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the unsullied. he looked them over coldly. magister illyrio growled something to him in the rough dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates.\\n\\n\\ndany noticed that her brother\\'s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. he looked almost as frightened as she felt. \"insolent eunuch,\" viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse.\\n\\n\\nmagister illyrio\\'s wo', 'rds were honey. \"many important men will be at the feast tonight. such men have enemies. the khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, your grace. no doubt the usurper would pay well for your head.\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh, yes,\" viserys said darkly. \"he has tried, illyrio, i promise you that. his hired knives follow us everywhere. i am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while i live.\"\\n\\n\\nthe palanquin slowed and stopped. the curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help dae', 'nerys out. his collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. her brother followed, one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt. it took two strong men to get magister illyrio back on his feet.\\n\\n\\ninside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. they were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the doom of valyria. oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a ', 'eunuch sang their coming. \"viserys of the house targaryen, the third of his name,\" he called in a high, sweet voice, \"king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men, lord of the sevenkingdoms and protector of the realm. his sister, daenerys stormborn, princess of dragonstone. his honorable host, illyrio mopatis, magister of the free city of pentos.\"\\n\\n\\nthey stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as t', 'he guests drifted among them. many were dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells. yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from pentos and myr and tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than illyrio, hairy men from the port of ibben, and lords from the summer isles with skin as black as ebony. daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden start of fear, that she w', 'as the only woman there.\\n\\nillyrio whispered to them. \"those three are drogo\\'s bloodriders, there,\" he said. \"by the pillar is khal moro, with his son rhogoro. the man with the green beard is brother to the archon of tyrosh, and the man behind him is ser jorah mormont.\"\\n\\n\\nthe last name caught daenerys. \"a knight?\"\\n\\n\\n\"no less.\" illyrio smiled through his beard. \"anointed with the seven oils by the high septon himself.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what is he doing here?\" she blurted.\\n\\n\\n\"the usurper wanted his head,\" illyri', 'o told them. \"some trifling affront. he sold some poachers to a tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the night\\'s watch. absurd law. a man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i shall wish to speak with ser jorah before the night is done,\" her brother said. dany found herself looking at the knight curiously. he was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. his tunic was a dark green, embroidere', 'd with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs.\\n\\n\\nshe was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when magister illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \"over there, sweet princess,\" he whispered, \"there is the khal himself.\"\\n\\n\\ndany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon. anxiously, she turned and looked at the man viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the nigh', 't was done.\\n\\n\\nthe slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. khal drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in illyrio\\'s menagerie. he was younger than she\\'d thought, no more than thirty. his skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings.\\n\\n\\n\"i must go and make my submissions,\" magister illyrio said. \"wait here. i shall bring him to you.\"\\n\\n\\nher brother took her by the arm ', 'as illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt. \"do you see his braid, sweet sister?\"\\n\\n\\ndrogo\\'s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved. it swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs.\\n\\n\\n\"you see how long it is?\" viserys said. \"when dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their sham', 'e. khal drogo has never lost a fight. he is aegon the dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\"\\n\\n\\ndany looked at khal drogo. his face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her. \"i don\\'t want to be his queen,\" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \"please, please, viserys, i don\\'t want to, i want to go home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"home?\" he kept his voice low, but she c', 'ould hear the fury in his tone. \"how are we to go home, sweet sister? they took our home from us!\" he drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into her skin. \"how are we to go home?\" he repeated, meaning king\\'s landing, and dragonstone, and all the realm they had lost.\\n\\n\\ndany had only meant their rooms in illyrio\\'s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother did not want to hear that. there was no home there for him. even the big house with the red door ', 'had not been home for him. his fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \"i don\\'t know . . . \"she said at last, her voice breaking. tears welled in her eyes.\\n\\n\\n\"i do,\" he said sharply. \"we go home with an army, sweet sister. with khal drogo\\'s army, that is how we go home. and if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\" he smiled at her. \"i\\'d let his whole khalasar f*ck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to get my', ' army. be grateful it is only drogo. in time you may even learn to like him. now dry your eyes. illyrio is bringing him over, and he will not see you crying.\"\\n\\n\\ndany turned and saw that it was true. magister illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting khal drogo over to where they stood. she brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand.\\n\\n\\n\"smile,\" viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \"and stand up straight. let him see that you have breasts. gods know,', ' you have little enough as is.\"\\n\\n\\ndaenerys smiled, and stood up straight.\\n\\neddard\\n\\n\\nthe visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of baratheon.\\n\\n\\nned knew many of the riders. there came ser jaime lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and', ' there sandor clegane with his terrible burned face. the tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the imp, tyrion lannister.\\n\\n\\nyet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \"ned! ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of y', 'ours.\" the king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \"you have not changed at all.\"\\n\\n\\nwould that ned had been able to say the same. fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a throne, the lord of storm\\'s end had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden\\'s fantasy. six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his house, he became a veritable giant. he\\'d had a giant\\'s strength too, his weapon o', \"f choice a spiked iron warhammer that ned could scarcely lift. in those days, the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume.\\n\\n\\nnow it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. ned had last seen the king nine years before during balon greyjoy's rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed king of the ironislands. since the night they had stood side by side in greyjoy's fallen stronghold,\", ' where robert had accepted the rebel lord\\'s surrender and ned had taken his son theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. a beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.\\n\\n\\nyet robert was ned\\'s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \"your grace. winterfell is yours.\"\\n\\n\\nby then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms w', \"ere coming forward for their mounts. robert's queen, cersei lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. the wheelhouse in which they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen's ring, while robert embraced catelyn like a long-lost sister. then the children had been brought forward, introduced, and approved of by both sides.\\n\\n\\nno sooner h\", 'ad those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \"take me down to your crypt, eddard. i would pay my respects.\"\\n\\n\\nned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. he called for a lantern. no other words were needed. the queen had begun to protest. they had been riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. the dead would wait. she had said no more than that; robert had looked at her, and her', ' twin brother jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she had said no more.\\n\\n\\nthey went down to the crypt together, ned and this king he scarcely recognized. the winding stone steps were narrow. ned went first with the lantern. \"i was starting to think we would never reach winterfell,\" robert complained as they descended. \"in the south, the way they talk about my seven kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i trust you enjoyed the journey, your grace?', '\"\\n\\n\\nrobert snorted. \"bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the neck. i\\'ve never seen such a vast emptiness. where are all your people?\"\\n\\n\\n\"likely they were too shy to come out,\" ned jested. he could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold breath from deep within the earth. \"kings are a rare sight in the north.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert snorted. \"more likely they were hiding under the snow. snow, ned!\" the king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended.\\n\\n\\n\"late su', 'mmer snows are common enough,\" ned said. \"i hope they did not trouble you. they are usually mild.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the others take your mild snows,\" robert swore. \"what will this place be like in winter? i shudder to think.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the winters are hard,\" ned admitted. \"but the starks will endure. we always have.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you need to come south,\" robert told him. \"you need a taste of summer before it flees. in highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. the fruits are so ri', 'pe they explode in your mouth - melons, peaches, fireplums, you\\'ve never tasted such sweetness. you\\'ll see, i brought you some. even at storm\\'s end, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can barely move. and you ought to see the towns, ned! flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with food, the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. everyone is fat and drunk and rich.\" he laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \"and the girl', 's, ned!\" he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"i swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. they swim na*ed in the river, right beneath the castle. even in the streets, it\\'s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it\\'s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\" the king laughed happily.\\n\\n\\nrobert baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who kn', 'ew how to take his pleasures. that was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of eddard stark. yet ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt.\\n\\n\\n\"your grace,\" ned said respectfully. he swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. shadows moved and lurched. flickering light touched the stones unde', 'rfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains. \"she is down at the end, with father and brandon.\"\\n\\n\\nhe led the way between the pillars and robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. it was always cold down here. their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault o', 'verhead as they walked among the dead of house stark. the lords of winterfell watched them pass. their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. in long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. the shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by.\\n\\n\\nby ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been lord of winterfell, to keep the vengeful s', 'pirits in their crypts. the oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. he hoped not. the first lords of winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. in the centuries before the dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no man, styling themselves the kings in the north.\\n\\n\\nned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. the crypt co', 'ntinued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. ned did not like to think on that. \"here,\" he told his king.\\n\\n\\nrobert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head.\\n\\n\\nthere were three tombs, side by side. lord rickard stark, ned\\'s father, had a long, stern face. the stonemason had known him well. he sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap, bu', 't in life all swords had failed him. in two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.\\n\\n\\nbrandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the mad king aerys targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed catelyn tully of riverrun. his father had been forced to watch him die. he was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule.\\n\\n\\nlyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. ned had loved her with all his heart. robert had loved her even more. she was', ' to have been his bride.\\n\\n\\n\"she was more beautiful than that,\" the king said after a silence. his eyes lingered on lyanna\\'s face, as if he could will her back to life. finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \"ah, damn it, ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?\" his voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \"she deserved more than darkness . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"she was a stark of winterfell,\" ned said quietly. \"this is her place.\"\\n\\n\\n\"she should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, wit', 'h the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i was with her when she died,\" ned reminded the king. \"she wanted to come home, to rest beside brandon and father.\" he could hear her still at times. promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. promise me, ned. the fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister\\'s eyes. ned remembered the way she had smiled then, h', 'ow tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. after that he remembered nothing. they had found him still holding her body, silent with grief. the little crannogman, howland reed, had taken her hand from his. ned could recall none of it. \"i bring her flowers when i can,\" he said . \"lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\"\\n\\n\\nthe king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were li', 'ving flesh. \"i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you did,\" ned reminded him.\\n\\n\\n\"only once,\" robert said bitterly.\\n\\nthey had come together at the ford of the trident while the battle crashed around them, robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the targaryen prince armored all in black. on his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his house, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. the waters of the trident ran red around the hooves of their', ' destriers as they circled and clashed, again and again, until at last a crushing blow from robert\\'s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. when ned had finally come on the scene, rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor.\\n\\n\\n\"in my dreams, i kill him every night,\" robert admitted. \"a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves.\"\\n\\n\\nthere was nothing ned could say to that. after a quiet, he s', 'aid, \"we should return, your grace. your wife will be waiting.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the others take my wife,\" robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily. \"and if i hear \\'your grace\\' once more, i\\'ll have your head on a spike. we are more to each other than that.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i had not forgotten,\" ned replied quietly. when the king did not answer, he said, \"tell me about jon.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert shook his head. \"i have never seen a man sicken so quickly. we gave a tourney on my s', 'on\\'s name day. if you had seen jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. a fortnight later he was dead. the sickness was like a fire in his gut. it burned right through him.\" he paused beside a pillar, before the tomb of a long-dead stark. \"i loved that old man.\"\\n\\n\\n\"we both did.\" ned paused a moment. \"catelyn fears for her sister. how does lysa bear her grief?\"\\n\\n\\nrobert\\'s mouth gave a bitter twist. \"not well, in truth,\" he admitted. \"i think losing jon has driven the woman mad, ned. ', 'she has taken the boy back to the eyrie. against my wishes. i had hoped to foster him with tywin lannister at casterly rock. jon had no brothers, no other sons. was i supposed to leave him to be raised by women?\"\\n\\n\\nned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to lord tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \"the wife has lost the husband,\" he said carefully. \"perhaps the mother feared to lose the son. the boy is very', ' young.\"\\n\\n\\n\"six, and sickly, and lord of the eyrie, gods have mercy,\" the king swore. \"lord tywin had never taken a ward before. lysa ought to have been honored. the lannisters are a great and noble house. she refused to even hear of it. then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. cersei was furious.\" he sighed deeply. \"the boy is my namesake, did you know that? robert arryn. i am sworn to protect him. how can i do that if his mother steals him away?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i will take h', 'im as ward, if you wish,\" ned said. \"lysa should consent to that. she and catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a generous offer, my friend,\" the king said, \"but too late. lord tywin has already given his consent. fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i have more concern for my nephew\\'s welfare than i do for lannister pride,\" ned declared.\\n\\n\\n\"that is because you do not sleep with a lannister.\" robert laughed, the sound rattling amon', 'g the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. his smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard. \"ah, ned,\" he said, \"you are still too serious.\" he put a massive arm around ned\\'s shoulders. \"i had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but i see now there\\'s no need for it. come, walk with me.\"\\n\\n\\nthey started back down between the pillars. blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. the king kept his arm around ned\\'s shoulder. \"you must have wondere', 'd why i finally came north to winterfell, after so long.\"\\n\\n\\nned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \"for the joy of my company, surely,\" he said lightly. \"and there is the wall. you need to see it, your grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it. the night\\'s watch is a shadow of what it once was. benjen says - \"\\n\\n\\n\"no doubt i will hear what your brother says soon enough,\" robert said. \"the wall has stood for what, eight thousand years? it can keep a few day', 's more. i have more pressing concerns. these are difficult times. i need good men about me. men like jon arryn. he served as lord of the eyrie, as warden of the east, as the hand of the king. he will not be easy to replace.\"\\n\\n\\n\"his son . . . \" ned began.\\n\\n\\n\"his son will succeed to the eyrie and all its incomes,\" robert said brusquely. \"no more.\"\\n\\n\\nthat took ned by surprise. he stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. the words came unbidden. \"the arryns have always been wardens of the ', 'east. the title goes with the domain.\"\\n\\n\\n\"perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\" robert said. \"i have this year to think of, and next. a six-year-old boy is no war leader, ned.\"\\n\\n\\n\"in peace, the title is only an honor. let the boy keep it. for his father\\'s sake if not his own. surely you owe jon that much for his service.\"\\n\\n\\nthe king was not pleased. he took his arm from around ned\\'s shoulders. \"jon\\'s service was the duty he owed his liege lord. i am not ungrateful, ned', '. you of all men ought to know that. but the son is not the father. a mere boy cannot hold the east.\" then his tone softened. \"enough of this. there is a more important office to discuss, and i would not argue with you.\" robert grasped ned by the elbow. \"i have need of you, ned.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i am yours to command, your grace. always.\" they were words he had to say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might come next.\\n\\n\\nrobert scarcely seemed to hear him. \"those years we spent in the eyrie . . . ', 'gods, those were good years. i want you at my side again, ned. i want you down in king\\'s landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.\" robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a stark. \"i swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse. and the people . . . there is no end of them. i sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain unt', 'il my mind is numb and my ass is raw. they all want something, money or land or justice. the lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. i am surrounded by flatterers and fools. it can drive a man to madness, ned. half of them don\\'t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can\\'t find it. there are nights i wish we had lost at the trident. ah, no, not truly, but . . .\\n\\n\\n\"i understand,\" ned said softly.\\n\\n\\nrobert looked at him. \"i think you do. if so, you are the only one, my old ', 'friend.\" he smiled. \"lord eddard stark, i would name you the hand of the king.\"\\n\\n\\nned dropped to one knee. the offer did not surprise him; what other reason could robert have had for coming so far? the hand of the king was the second-most powerful man in the seven kingdoms. he spoke with the king\\'s voice, commanded the king\\'s armies, drafted the king\\'s laws. at times he even sat upon the iron throne to dispense king\\'s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed. robert wa', 's offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself.\\n\\n\\nit was the last thing in the world he wanted.\\n\\n\\n\"your grace,\" he said. \"i am not worthy of the honor.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert groaned with good-humored impatience. \"if i wanted to honor you, i\\'d let you retire. i am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while i eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.\" he slapped his gut and grinned. \"you know the saying, about the king and his hand?\"\\n\\n\\nned knew the saying. \"what the ', 'king dreams,\" he said, \"the hand builds.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. the king eats, they say, and the hand takes the shit.\" he threw back his head and roared his laughter. the echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the dead of winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes.\\n\\n\\nfinally the laughter dwindled and stopped. ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \"damn it, ned,\" the king complained. \"you might at l', 'east humor me with a smile.\"\\n\\n\\n\"they say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man\\'s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,\" ned said evenly. \"perhaps that is why the starks have so little humor.\"\\n\\n\\n\"come south with me, and i\\'ll teach you how to laugh again,\" the king promised. \"you helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. we were meant to rule together. if lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. well, it is not to', 'o late. i have a son. you have a daughter. my joff and your sansa shall join our houses, as lyanna and i might once have done.\"\\n\\n\\nthis offer did surprise him. \"sansa is only eleven.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert waved an impatient hand. \"old enough for betrothal. the marriage can wait a few years.\" the king smiled. \"now stand up and say yes, curse you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"nothing would give me greater pleasure, your grace,\" ned answered. he hesitated. \"these honors are all so unexpected. may i have some time to consider? i need to', ' tell my wife . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"yes, yes, of course, tell catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\" the king reached down, clasped ned by the hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. \"just don\\'t keep me waiting too long. i am not the most patient of men.\"\\n\\n\\nfor a moment eddard stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. this was his place, here in the north. he looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. he could feel the eyes of the dead. they were', ' all listening, he knew. and winter was coming.\\n\\njon\\n\\n\\nthere were times - not many, but a few - when jon snow was glad he was a bastard. as he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.\\n\\n\\nhe settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. the sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.\\n\\n\\nthe great hall of winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted me', \"at and fresh-baked bread. its grey stone walls were draped with banners. white, gold, crimson: the direwolf of stark, baratheon's crowned stag, the lion of lannister. a singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.\\n\\n\\nit was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. jon's brothers and \", \"sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where lord and lady stark hosted the king and queen. in honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. down here on the benches, there was no one to stop jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.\\n\\n\\nand he was finding that he had a man's thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. they were fi\", \"ne company, and jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. he was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king's offspring. he had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. the procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and jon had gotten a good long look at them all.\\n\\n\\nhis lord father had come first, escorting the queen. she was as beautiful as men said. a jeweled tiar\", 'a gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. his father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. even at fourteen, jon could see through her smile.\\n\\n\\nnext had come king robert himself, with lady stark on his arm. the king was a great disappointment to jon. his father had talked of him often: the peerless robert baratheon, demon of the trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a g', 'iant among princes. jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. he walked like a man half in his cups.\\n\\n\\nafter them came the children. little rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster. jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. close behind came robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the stark colors. he had the princess myrcella on his arm. she was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of gold', \"en curls under a jeweled net. jon noticed the shy looks she gave robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. he decided she was insipid. robb didn't even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.\\n\\n\\nhis half sisters escorted the royal princes. arya was paired with plump young tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, joffrey baratheon. he was twelve, younger than jon or robb,\", \" but taller than either, to jon's vast dismay. prince joffrey had his sister's hair and his mother's deep green eyes. a thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar. sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but jon did not like joffrey's pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at winterfell's great hall.\\n\\n\\nhe was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen's brothers, the lannisters of casterly rock. the lion and the imp; \", 'there was no mistaking which was which. ser jaime lannister was twin to queen cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. he wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. on the breast of his tunic, the lion of his house was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. they called him the lion of lannister to his face and whispered \"kingslayer\" behind his back.\\n\\n\\njon found it hard to look away from him. this is what a king should look lik', \"e, he thought to himself as the man passed.\\n\\n\\nthen he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother's side. tyrion lannister, the youngest of lord tywin's brood and by far the ugliest. all that the gods had given to cersei and jaime, they had denied tyrion. he was a dwarf, half his brother's height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. his head was too large for his body, with a brute's squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. one green eye and one black one peered ou\", \"t from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. jon watched him with fascination.\\n\\n\\nthe last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, benjen stark of the night's watch, and his father's ward, young theon greyjoy. benjen gave jon a warm smile as he went by. theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. after all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.\\n\\njon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.\\n\\n\\nsome\", 'thing rubbed against his leg beneath the table. jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \"hungry again?\" he asked. there was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. he knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs. ghost ripped into it in savage silence. his brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than jon could count at this en', 'd of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup. he told himself he was fortunate in that too.\\n\\n\\nhis eyes stung. jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. he swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.\\n\\n\\ndogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. one of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. she stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. jon watched the confrontation. the bitch g', 'rowled low in her throat and moved closer. ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. the bitch snapped an angry challenge. she was three times the size of the direwolf pup. ghost did not move. he stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. the bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. she turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. ghost went back to his meal.\\n\\n\\njon grinned and reached under the table to ruf', 'fle the shaggy white fur. the direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.\\n\\n\\n\"is this one of the direwolves i\\'ve heard so much of?\" a familiar voice asked close at hand.\\n\\n\\njon looked up happily as his uncle ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as jon had ruffled the wolf\\'s. \"yes,\" he said. \"his name is ghost.\"\\n\\n\\none of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he\\'d been telling to make room at the table for their lord\\'s brother. benjen stark strad', 'dled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of jon\\'s hand. \"summerwine,\" he said after a taste. \"nothing so sweet. how many cups have you had, jon?\"\\n\\n\\njon smiled.\\n\\n\\nben stark laughed. \"as i feared. ah, well. i believe i was younger than you the first time i got truly and sincerely drunk.\" he snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it. it crunched.\\n\\n\\nhis uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint o', 'f laughter in his blue-grey eyes. he dressed in black, as befitted a man of the night\\'s watch. tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. a heavy silver chain was looped round his neck. benjen watched ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \"a very quiet wolf,\" he observed.\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s not like the others,\" jon said. \"he never makes a sound. that\\'s why i named him ghost. that, and because he\\'s white. the others are all dark, grey or black.\"\\n\\n\\n\"t', 'here are still direwolves beyond the wall. we hear them on our rangings.\" benjen stark gave jon a long look. \"don\\'t you usually eat at table with your brothers?\"\\n\\n\\n\"most times,\" jon answered in a flat voice. \"but tonight lady stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i see.\" his uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall . \"my brother does not seem very festive tonight.\"\\n\\n\\njon had noticed that too. a bastard had t', 'o learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes. his father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that jon had seldom seen before. he said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night. his broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. he made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the qu', 'een seemed as cold as an ice sculpture. \"the queen is angry too,\" jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \"father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. the queen didn\\'t want him to go.\"\\n\\n\\nbenjen gave jon a careful, measuring look. \"you don\\'t miss much, do you, jon? we could use a man like you on the wall.\"\\n\\n\\njon swelled with pride. \"robb is a stronger lance than i am, but i\\'m the better sword, and hullen says i sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\"\\n\\n\\n\"notable achievements.\"\\n', '\\n\\n\"take me with you when you go back to the wall,\" jon said in a sudden rush. \"father will give me leave to go if you ask him, i know he will.\"\\n\\n\\nuncle benjen studied his face carefully. \"the wall is a hard place for a boy, jon.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i am almost a man grown,\" jon protested. \"i will turn fifteen on my next name day, and maester luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that\\'s true enough,\" benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. he took jon\\'s cup from the table, filled it', ' fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.\\n\\n\\n\"daeren targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered dorne,\" jon said. the young dragon was one of his heroes.\\n\\n\\n\"a conquest that lasted a summer,\" his uncle pointed out. \"your boy king lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. someone should have told him that war isn\\'t a game.\" he took another sip of wine. \"also,\" he said, wiping his mouth, \"daeren targaryen was only eighteen when he died. or hav', 'e you forgotten that part?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i forget nothing,\" jon boasted. the wine was making him bold. he tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller. \"i want to serve in the night\\'s watch, uncle.\"\\n\\n\\nhe had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. robb would someday inherit winterfell, would command great armies as the warden of the north. bran and rickon would be robb\\'s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. his sisters arya and sansa would marr', 'y the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. but what place could a bastard hope to earn?\\n\\n\\n\"you don\\'t know what you\\'re asking, jon. the night\\'s watch is a sworn brotherhood. we have no families. none of us will ever father sons. our wife is duty. our mistress is honor.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a bastard can have honor too,\" jon said. \"i am ready to swear your oath.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you are a boy of fourteen,\" benjen said. \"not a man, not yet. until you have known a woman, you cannot unders', 'tand what you would be giving up.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care about that!\" jon said hotly.\\n\\n\\n\"you might, if you knew what it meant,\" benjen said. \"if you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.\"\\n\\n\\njon felt anger rise inside him. \"i\\'m not your son!\"\\n\\n\\nbenjen stark stood up. \"more\\'s the pity.\" he put a hand on jon\\'s shoulder. \"come back to me after you\\'ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\\'ll see how you feel.\"\\n\\n\\njon trembled. \"i will never father a bastard,', '\" he said carefully. \"never!\" he spat it out like venom.\\n\\n\\nsuddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. he felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. he pushed himself to his feet.\\n\\n\\n\"i must be excused,\" he said with the last of his dignity. he whirled and bolted before they could see him cry. he must have drunk more wine than he had realized. his feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a', ' flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. laughter boomed all around him, and jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. someone tried to steady him. he wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.\\n\\n\\nthe yard was quiet and empty. a lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. he looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but jon would have traded plac', 'es with him in an instant. otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there. winterfell reminded him of that tonight.\\n\\n\\nthe sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. they were the last things jon wanted to hear. he wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.\\n\\n\\n\"boy,', '\" a voice called out to him. jon turned.\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the great hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. the dwarf grinned down at him. \"is that animal a wolf?\"\\n\\n\\n\"a direwolf,\" jon said. \"his name is ghost.\" he stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten. \"what are you doing up there? why aren\\'t you at the feast?\"\\n\\n\\n\"too hot, too noisy, and i\\'d drunk too much wine,\" the dwarf told him. \"i learned long ago that it is ', 'considered rude to vomit on your brother. might i have a closer look at your wolf?\"\\n\\n\\njon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"can you climb down, or shall i bring a ladder?\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh, bleed that,\" the little man said. he pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. jon gasped, then watched with awe as tyrion lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.\\n\\n\\nghost backed away from him uncertainly.\\n\\n\\nthe dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \"i bel', 'ieve i\\'ve frightened your wolf. my apologies.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s not scared,\" jon said. he knelt and called out. \"ghost, come here. come on. that\\'s it.\"\\n\\n\\nthe wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at jon\\'s face, but he kept a wary eye on tyrion lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \"shy, isn\\'t he?\" lannister observed.\\n\\n\\n\"sit, ghost,\" jon commanded. \"that\\'s it. keep still.\" he looked up at the dwarf. \"you can touch him now. he won\\'t move unti', 'l i tell him to. i\\'ve been training him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i see,\" lannister said. he ruffled the snow-white fur between ghost\\'s ears and said, \"nice wolf.\"\\n\\n\\n\"if i wasn\\'t here, he\\'d tear out your throat,\" jon said. it wasn\\'t actually true yet, but it would be.\\n\\n\\n\"in that case, you had best stay close,\" the dwarf said. he cocked his oversized head to one side and looked jon over with his mismatched eyes. \"i am tyrion lannister.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i know,\" jon said. he rose. standing, he was taller than the dwarf. it made hi', 'm feel strange.\\n\\n\\n\"you\\'re ned stark\\'s bastard, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\njon felt a coldness pass right through him. he pressed his lips together and said nothing.\\n\\n\\n\"did i offend you?\" lannister said. \"sorry. dwarfs don\\'t have to be tactful. generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\" he grinned. \"you are the bastard, though.\"\\n\\n\\n\"lord eddard stark is my father,\" jon admitted stiffly.\\n\\n\\nlannister studied his face. \"yes,\" he s', 'aid. \"i can see it. you have more of the north in you than your brothers.\"\\n\\n\\n\"half brothers,\" jon corrected. he was pleased by the dwarf\\'s comment, but he tried not to let it show.\\n\\n\\n\"let me give you some counsel, bastard,\" lannister said. \"never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. make it your strength. then it can never be your weakness. armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.\"\\n\\n\\njon was in no mood for anyone\\'s counsel. \"what do you know about being a basta', 'rd?\"\\n\\n\\n\"all dwarfs are bastards in their father\\'s eyes.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you are your mother\\'s trueborn son of lannister.\"\\n\\n\\n\"am i?\" the dwarf replied, sardonic. \"do tell my lord father. my mother died birthing me, and he\\'s never been sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t even know who my mother was,\" jon said.\\n\\n\\n\"some woman, no doubt. most of them are.\" he favored jon with a rueful grin. \"remember this, boy. all dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\" and with that he turned and sauntered back into the fe', \"ast, whistling a tune. when he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment tyrion lannister stood tall as a king.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn\\n\\n\\nof all the rooms in winterfell's great keep, catelyn's bedchambers were the hottest. she seldom had to light a fire. the castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man's body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the g\", \"lass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. that was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn's bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. the warmth reminded her of riverrun, of days in the sun with lysa and edmure, but ned could never abide the heat. the starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him\", ' in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place.\\n\\n\\nso when they had finished, ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. he crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.\\n\\n\\nthe wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, na*ed and empty-handed. catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. he looked somehow smaller and more vulner', 'able, like the youth she had wed in the sept at riverrun, fifteen long years gone. her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. it was a good ache. she could feel his seed within her. she prayed that it might quicken there. it had been three years since rickon. she was not too old. she could give him another son.\\n\\n\\n\"i will refuse him,\" ned said as he turned back to her. his eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn sat up in the bed. \"you cannot. you must not.\"\\n\\n\\n\"my ', 'duties are here in the north. i have no wish to be robert\\'s hand.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he will not understand that. he is a king now, and kings are not like other men. if you refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. can\\'t you see the danger that would put us in?\"\\n\\n\\nned shook his head, refusing to believe. \"robert would never harm me or any of mine. we were closer than brothers. he loves me. if i refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and ', 'in a week we will laugh about it together. i know the man!\"\\n\\n\"you knew the man,\" she said. \"the king is a stranger to you.\" catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. she had to make him see. \"pride is everything to a king, my lord. robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.\"\\n\\n\\n\"honors?\" ned laughed bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\"in his eyes, yes,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n\"and in yours?\"\\n\\n\\n\"and in mine,\" she', ' blazed, angry now. why couldn\\'t he see? \"he offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? sansa might someday be queen. her sons could rule from the wall to the mountains of dorne. what is so wrong with that?\"\\n\\n\\n\"gods, catelyn, sansa is only eleven,\" ned said. \"and joffrey . . . joffrey is . . . \"\\n\\n\\nshe finished for him. \" . . . crown prince, and heir to the iron throne. and i was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother brandon.\"\\n\\n\\nthat brought a ', 'bitter twist to ned\\'s mouth. \"brandon. yes. brandon would know what to do. he always did. it was all meant for brandon. you, winterfell, everything. he was born to be a king\\'s hand and a father to queens. i never asked for this cup to pass to me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"perhaps not,\" catelyn said, \"but brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or not.\"\\n\\n\\nned turned away from her, back to the night. he stood staring out in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or p', 'erhaps the sentries on the wall.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn softened then, to see his pain. eddard stark had married her in brandon\\'s place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son.\\n\\n\\nshe was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. ned turned, frowning. \"what is it?\"\\n\\n\\ndesmond\\'s voice came through the door. \"my lord, maester luwin is witho', 'ut and begs urgent audience.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you told him i had left orders not to be disturbed?\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes, my lord. he insists.\"\\n\\n\\n\"very well. send him in.\"\\n\\n\\nned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become. she sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \"perhaps we should close the windows,\" she suggested.\\n\\n\\nned nodded absently. maester luwin was shown in.\\n\\n\\nthe maester was a small grey man. his eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. his hair w', 'as grey, what little the years had left him. his robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the stark colors. its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. with all he kept hidden in his sleeves, catelyn was surprised that maester luwin could lift his arms at all.\\n\\n\\nthe maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \"my l', 'ord,\" he said to ned, \"pardon for disturbing your rest. i have been left a message.\"\\n\\n\\nned looked irritated. \"been left? by whom? has there been a rider? i was not told.\"\\n\\n\\n\"there was no rider, my lord. only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while i napped. my servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king\\'s party. we have had no other visitors from the south.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a wooden box, you say?\" catelyn said.\\n\\n\\n\"inside was a fine new lens for the observato', 'ry, from myr by the look of it. the lenscrafters of myr are without equal.\"\\n\\n\\nned frowned. he had little patience for this sort of thing, catelyn knew. \"a lens,\" he said. \"what has that to do with me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i asked the same question,\" maester luwin said. \"clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\"\\n\\n\\nunder the heavy weight of her furs, catelyn shivered. \"a lens is an instrument to help us see.\"\\n\\n\\n\"indeed it is.\" he fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck be', 'neath his robe, each link forged from a different metal.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \"what is it that they would have us see more clearly?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the very thing i asked myself.\" maester luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. \"i found the true message concealed within a false bottom when i dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.\"\\n\\n\\nned held out his hand. \"let me have it, then.\"\\n\\n\\nluwin did not stir. \"pardons, my lord. the messa', 'ge is not for you either. it is marked for the eyes of the lady catelyn, and her alone. may i approach?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. the maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. it was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. luwin bowed and began to retreat.\\n\\n\\n\"stay,\" ned commanded him. his voice was grave. he looked at catelyn. \"what is it? my lady, you\\'re shaking.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m afraid,\" she admitted. she reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. the furs dropped awa', 'y from her nakedness, forgotten. in the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of house arryn. \"it\\'s from lysa.\" catelyn looked at her husband. \"it will not make us glad,\" she told him. \"there is grief in this message, ned. i can feel it.\"\\n\\n\\nned frowned, his face darkening. \"open it.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn broke the seal.\\n\\n\\nher eyes moved over the words. at first they made no sense to her. then she remembered. \"lysa took no chances. when we were girls together, we had a private language, she and i.\"\\n\\n\\n\"can y', 'ou read it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" catelyn admitted.\\n\\n\\n\"then tell us.\"\\n\\n\\n\"perhaps i should withdraw,\" maester luwin said.\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" catelyn said. \"we will need your counsel.\" she threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. the night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room.\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin averted his eyes. even ned looked shocked. \"what are you doing?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\"lighting a fire,\" catelyn told him. she found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the cold ', 'hearth.\\n\\n\\n\"maester luwin - \" ned began.\\n\\n\\n\"maester luwin has delivered all my children,\" catelyn said. \"this is no time for false modesty.\" she slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it.\\n\\n\\nned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. he held her there, his face inches from her. \"my lady, tell me! what was this message?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn stiffened in his grasp. \"a warning,\" she said softly. \"if we have the wits to hear.\"\\n\\n\\nhis eyes searched h', 'er face. \"go on.\"\\n\\n\\n\"lysa says jon arryn was murdered.\"\\n\\n\\nhis fingers tightened on her arm. \"by whom?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the lannisters,\" she told him. \"the queen.\"\\n\\n\\nned released his hold on her arm. there were deep red marks on her skin. \"gods,\" he whispered. his voice was hoarse. \"your sister is sick with grief. she cannot know what she is saying.\"\\n\\n\\n\"she knows,\" catelyn said. \"lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden. she knew it meant death if her letter fell into th', 'e wrong hands . to risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.\" catelyn looked to her husband. \"now we truly have no choice. you must be robert\\'s hand. you must go south with him and learn the truth.\"\\n\\n\\nshe saw at once that ned had reached a very different conclusion. \"the only truths i know are here. the south is a nest of adders i would do better to avoid.\"\\n\\n\\nluwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \"the hand of the king has great power, ', 'my lord. power to find the truth of lord arryn\\'s death, to bring his killers to the king\\'s justice. power to protect lady arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\"\\n\\n\\nned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. catelyn\\'s heart went out to him, but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then. first the victory must be won, for her children\\'s sake. \"you say you love robert like a brother. would you leave your brother surrounded by lannisters?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the others take both of you,\" ned mutter', 'ed darkly. he turned away from them and went to the window. she did not speak, nor did the maester. they waited, quiet, while eddard stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved. when he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes. \"my father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. he never came home again.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a different time,\" maester luwin said. \"a different king.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" ned said ', 'dully. he seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \"catelyn, you shall stay here in winterfell.\"\\n\\n\\nhis words were like an icy draft through her heart. \"no,\" she said, suddenly afraid. was this to be her punishment? never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \"you must govern the north in my stead, while i run robert\\'s errands. there must always be a stark in winterfell. robb is fourteen. soon enough, he will be a man gro', 'wn. he must learn to rule, and i will not be here for him. make him part of your councils. he must be ready when his time comes.\"\\n\\n\\n\"gods will, not for many years,\" maester luwin murmured.\\n\\n\\n\"maester luwin, i trust you as i would my own blood. give my wife your voice in all things great and small. teach my son the things he needs to know. winter is coming.\"\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin nodded gravely. then silence fell, until catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded. \"wh', 'at of the other children?\"\\n\\n\\nned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \"rickon is very young,\" he said gently. \"he should stay here with you and robb. the others i would take with me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i could not bear it,\" catelyn said, trembling.\\n\\n\\n\"you must,\" he said. \"sansa must wed joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion. and it is past time that arya learned the ways of a southron court. in a few years she will be of an age to marry too', '.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa would shine in the south, catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that arya needed refinement. reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. but not bran. never bran. \"yes,\" she said, \"but please, ned, for the love you bear me, let bran remain here at winterfell. he is only seven.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i was eight when my father sent me to foster at the eyrie,\" ned said. \"ser rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between robb and prince joffrey. that is not healthy. bran can bridge that distance. ', 'he is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as robert became mine. our house will be the safer for it.\"\\n\\n\\nhe was right; catelyn knew it. it did not make the pain any easier to bear. she would lose all four of them, then: ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving bran. only robb and little rickon would be left to her. she felt lonely already. winterfell was such a vast place. \"keep him off the walls, then,\" she said bravely', '. \"you know how bran loves to climb.\"\\n\\n\\nned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \"thank you, my lady,\" he whispered. \"this is hard, i know.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what of jon snow, my lord?\" maester luwin asked.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn tensed at the mention of the name. ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.\\n\\n\\nmany men fathered bastards. catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. it came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met', \" on campaign. he had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father's castle at riverrun. her thoughts were more of robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. he was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. and if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child's needs.\\n\\n\\nhe did more than that. the starks were not like other men. ned brought his bastard home wi\", 'th him, and called him \"son\" for all the north to see. when the wars were over at last, and catelyn rode to winterfell, jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.\\n\\n\\nthat cut deep. ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband\\'s soldiers. they whispered of ser arthur dayne, the sword of the morning, deadliest of the seven knights of aerys\\'s kingsguard, and of how', \" their young lord had slain him in single combat. and they told how afterward ned had carried ser arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called starfall on the shores of the summersea. the lady ashara dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. it had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.\\n\\n\\nthat was the only time in all their years that ned had \", 'ever frightened her. \"never ask me about jon,\" he said, cold as ice. \"he is my blood, and that is all you need to know. and now i will learn where you heard that name, my lady.\" she had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and ashara dayne\\'s name was never heard in winterfell again.\\n\\n\\nwhoever jon\\'s mother had been, ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. it was the one thing she could never fo', 'rgive him. she had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love jon. she might have overlooked a dozen bastards for ned\\'s sake, so long as they were out of sight. jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. somehow that made it worse. \"jon must go,\" she said now.\\n\\n\\n\"he and robb are close,\" ned said. \"i had hoped . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"he cannot stay here,\" catelyn said, cutting him off. \"he is your ', 'son, not mine. i will not have him.\" it was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at winterfell.\\n\\n\\nthe look ned gave her was anguished. \"you know i cannot take him south. there will be no place for him at court. a boy with a bastard\\'s name . . . you know what they will say of him. he will be shunned.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\\'s eyes. \"they say your friend robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\"', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\"and none of them has ever been seen at court!\" ned blazed. \"the lannister woman has seen to that. how can you be so damnably cruel, catelyn? he is only a boy. he - \"\\n\\n\\nhis fury was on him. he might have said more, and worse, but maester luwin cut in. \"another solution presents itself,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"your brother benjen came to me about jon a few days ago. it seems the boy aspires to take the black.\"\\n\\n\\nned looked shocked. \"he asked to join the night\\'s watch?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn said noth', 'ing. let ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. his was the perfect solution. benjen stark was a sworn brother. jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. and in time the boy would take the oath as well. he would father no sons who might someday contest with catelyn\\'s own grandchildren for winterfell.\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin said, \"there is great honor in service on the wall, my lord.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and even a bast', 'ard may rise high in the night\\'s watch,\" ned reflected. still, his voice was troubled. \"jon is so young. if he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteen . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"a hard sacrifice,\" maester luwin agreed. \"yet these are hard times, my lord. his road is no crueler than yours or your lady\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn thought of the three children she must lose. it was not easy keeping silent then.\\n\\n\\nned turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent an', 'd thoughtful. finally he sighed, and turned back. \"very well,\" he said to maester luwin. \"i suppose it is for the best. i will speak to ben.\"\\n\\n\\n\"when shall we tell jon?\" the maester asked.\\n\\n\\n\"when i must. preparations must be made. it will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. i would sooner let jon enjoy these last few days. summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. when the time comes, i will tell him myself.\"\\n\\n\\narya\\n\\n\\narya\\'s stitches were crooked again.\\n\\n\\nshe frowned down at', ' them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister sansa sat among the other girls. sansa\\'s needlework was exquisite. everyone said so. \"sansa\\'s work is as pretty as she is,\" septa mordane told their lady mother once. \"she has such fine, delicate hands.\" when lady catelyn had asked about arya, the septa had sniffed. \"arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\"\\n\\n\\narya glanced furtively across the room, worried that septa mordane might have read her thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention', \" today. she was sitting with the princess myrcella, all smiles and admiration. it was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she had said when the queen brought myrcella to join them. arya thought that myrcella's stitches looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way septa mordane was cooing.\\n\\n\\nshe studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the needle. she looked glumly at \", 'her sister. sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. beth cassel, ser rodrik\\'s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and jeyne poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.\\n\\n\\n\"what are you talking about?\" arya asked suddenly.\\n\\n\\njeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. sansa looked abashed. beth blushed. no one answered.\\n\\n\\n\"tell me,\" arya said.\\n\\n\\njeyne glanced over to make certain that septa mordane was not listening. myrcella said something ', 'then, and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies.\\n\\n\\n\"we were talking about the prince,\" sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss.\\n\\n\\narya knew which prince she meant: jofftey, of course. the tall, handsome one. sansa got to sit with him at the feast. arya had to sit with the little fat one. naturally.\\n\\n\\n\"joffrey likes your sister,\" jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. she was the daughter of winterfell\\'s steward and sansa\\'s dearest friend. \"he told her she was ve', 'ry beautiful.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s going to marry her,\" little beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \"then sansa will be queen of all the realm.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa had the grace to blush. she blushed prettily. she did everything prettily, arya thought with dull resentment. \"beth, you shouldn\\'t make up stories,\" sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. she looked at arya. \"what did you think of prince joff, sister? he\\'s very gallant, don\\'t you think?\"\\n\\n\\n\"jon say', 's he looks like a girl,\" arya said.\\n\\n\\nsansa sighed as she stitched. \"poor jon,\" she said. \"he gets jealous because he\\'s a bastard.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s our brother,\" arya said, much too loudly. her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.\\n\\n\\nsepta mordane raised her eyes. she had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. it was frowning now. \"what are you talking about, children?\"\\n\\n\\n\"our half brother,\" sansa corrected, soft and precise. she smiled for the septa. \"ar', 'ya and i were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\" she said.\\n\\n\\nsepta mordane nodded. \"indeed. a great honor for us all.\" princess myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment. \"arya, why aren\\'t you at work?\" the septa asked. she rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \"let me see your stitches.\"\\n\\n\\narya wanted to scream. it was just like sansa to go and attract the septa\\'s attention. \"here,\" she said, surrendering up her work.\\n\\n', '\\nthe septa examined the fabric. \"arya, arya, arya,\" she said. \"this will not do. this will not do at all.\"\\n\\n\\neveryone was looking at her. it was too much. sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\\'s disgrace, but jeyne was smirking on her behalf. even princess myrcella looked sorry for her. arya felt tears filling her eyes. she pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.\\n\\n\\nsepta mordane called after her. \"arya, come back here! don\\'t you take another step! your lady mother will ', 'hear of this. in front of our royal princess too! you\\'ll shame us all!\"\\n\\n\\narya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. the tears were running down her cheeks now. she managed a stiff little bow to myrcella. \"by your leave, my lady.\"\\n\\n\\nmyrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. but if she was uncertain, septa mordane was not. \"just where do you think you are going, arya?\" the septa demanded.\\n\\n\\narya glared at her. \"i have to go shoe a horse,\" she said sweetly, taki', \"ng a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa's face. then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her.\\n\\n\\nit wasn't fair. sansa had everything. sansa was two years older; maybe by the time arya had been born, there had been nothing left. often it felt that way. sansa could sew and dance and sing. she wrote poetry. she knew how to dress. she played the high harp and the bells. worse, she was beautiful. sansa had gotten their mother's fine high chee\", 'kbones and the thick auburn hair of the tullys. arya took after their lord father. her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. jeyne used to call her arya horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. it hurt that the one thing arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. well, that and manage a household. sansa had never had much of a head for figures. if she did marry prince joff, arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.\\n\\n\\nnymeria was waiting for her ', 'in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. she bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of arya. arya grinned. the wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. they went everywhere together, and nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. if mother had not forbidden it, arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. let septa mordane complain about her stitches then.\\n\\n\\nnymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as arya untied her. she had yellow eyes. when they caught the s', 'unlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. arya had named her after the warrior queen of the rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. that had been a great scandal too. sansa, of course, had named her pup \"lady.\" arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.\\n\\n\\nby now septa mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. if she went to her room, they would find her. arya did not care to be found. she had a better notion. the boy', 's were at practice in the yard. she wanted to see robb put gallant prince joffrey flat on his back. \"come,\" she whispered to nymeria. she got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.\\n\\n\\nthere was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the great keep where you had a view of the whole yard. that was where they headed.\\n\\n\\nthey arrived, flushed and breathless, to find jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. he was watching the action, so absorbed that he se', 'emed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.\\n\\n\\njon gave her a curious look. \"shouldn\\'t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\"\\n\\n\\narya made a face at him. \"i wanted to see them fight.\"\\n\\n\\nhe smiled. \"come here, then.\"\\n\\n\\narya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.', \"\\n\\n\\nto her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling . bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and prince tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. they were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old ser rodrik cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. a dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, robb's\", ' voice the loudest among them. she spotted theon greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his house, a look of wry contempt on his face. both of the combatants were staggering. arya judged that they had been at it awhile.\\n\\n\\n\"a shade more exhausting than needlework,\" jon observed.\\n\\n\\n\"a shade more fun than needlework,\" arya gave back at him. jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. arya flushed. they had always been close. jon had their father\\'s face, as', ' she did. they were the only ones. robb and sansa and bran and even little rickon all took after the tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. when arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. it been jon she had gone to in her fear, and jon who had reassured her.\\n\\n\\n\"why aren\\'t you down in the yard?\" arya asked him.\\n\\n\\nhe gave her a half smile. \"bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\" he said. \"any bruises they take in the practice yard must c', 'ome from trueborn swords.\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh.\" arya felt abashed. she should have realized. for the second time today, arya reflected that life was not fair.\\n\\n\\nshe watched her little brother whack at tommen. \"i could do just as good as bran,\" she said. \"he\\'s only seven. i\\'m nine.\"\\n\\n\\njon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \"you\\'re too skinny,\" he said. he took her arm to feel her muscle. then he sighed and shook his head. \"i doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind ', 'swing one.\"\\n\\n\\narya snatched back her arm and glared at him. jon messed up her hair again. they watched bran and tommen circle each other.\\n\\n\\n\"you see prince joffrey?\" jon asked.\\n\\n\\nshe hadn\\'t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall. he was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of lannister and baratheon, strangers all. there were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised.\\n\\n\\n\"look at the', ' arms on his surcoat,\" jon suggested.\\n\\n\\narya looked. an ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince\\'s padded surcoat. no doubt the needlework was exquisite. the arms were pided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal house, on the other the lion of lannister.\\n\\n\\n\"the lannisters are proud,\" jon observed. \"you\\'d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. he makes his mother\\'s house equal in honor to the king\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the woman is important too!\" arya protested.\\n\\n\\nj', 'on chuckled. \"perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. wed tully to stark in your arms.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a wolf with a fish in its mouth?\" it made her laugh. \"that would look silly. besides, if a girl can\\'t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\"\\n\\n\\njon shrugged. \"girls get the arms but not the swords. bastards get the swords but not the arms. i did not make the rules, little sister.\"\\n\\n\\nthere was a shout from the courtyard below. prince tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and fail', 'ing. all the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. the men began to laugh.\\n\\n\\n\"enough!\" ser rodrik called out. he gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet. \"well fought. lew, donnis, help them out of their armor.\" he looked around. \"prince joffrey, robb, will you go another round?\"\\n\\n\\nrobb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. \"gladly.\"\\n\\n\\njoffre', 'y moved into the sunlight in response to rodrik\\'s summons. his hair shone like spun gold. he looked bored. \"this is a game for children, ser rodrik.\"\\n\\n\\ntheon greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \"you are children,\" he said derisively.\\n\\n\\n\"robb may be a child,\" joffrey said. \"i am a prince. and i grow tired of swatting at starks with a play sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you got more swats than you gave, joff,\" robb said. \"are you afraid?\"\\n\\n\\nprince joffrey looked at him. \"oh, terrified,\" he said. \"you\\'re so much o', 'lder.\" some of the lannister men laughed.\\n\\n\\njon looked down on the scene with a frown. \"joffrey is truly a little shit,\" he told arya.\\n\\n\\nser rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. \"what are you suggesting?\" he asked the prince.\\n\\n\\n\"live steel.\"\\n\\n\\n\"done,\" robb shot back. \"you\\'ll be sorry!\"\\n\\n\\nthe master-at-arms put a hand on robb\\'s shoulder to quiet him. \"live steel is too dangerous. i will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\"\\n\\n\\njoffrey said nothing, but a man strange to arya,', ' a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, pushed forward in front of the prince. \"this is your prince. who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?\"\\n\\n\"master-at-arms of winterfell, clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"are you training women here?\" the burned man wanted to know. he was muscled like a bull.\\n\\n\\n\"i am training knights,\" ser rodrik said pointedly. \"they will have steel when they are ready. when they are of an age.\"\\n\\n\\nthe burned ma', 'n looked at robb. \"how old are you, boy?\"\\n\\n\\n\"fourteen,\" robb said.\\n\\n\\n\"i killed a man at twelve. you can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\"\\n\\n\\narya could see robb bristle. his pride was wounded. he turned on ser rodrik. \"let me do it. i can beat him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"beat him with a tourney blade, then,\" ser rodrik said.\\n\\n\\njoffrey shrugged. \"come and see me when you\\'re older, stark. if you\\'re not too old.\" there was laughter from the lannister men.\\n\\n\\nrobb\\'s curses rang through the yard. arya covered her m', 'outh in shock. theon greyjoy seized robb\\'s arm to keep him away from the prince. ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay.\\n\\n\\njoffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \"come, tommen,\" he said. \"the hour of play is done. leave the children to their frolics.\"\\n\\n\\nthat brought more laughter from the lannisters, more curses from robb. ser rodrik\\'s face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. theon kept robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were', ' safely away.\\n\\n\\njon watched them leave, and arya watched jon. his face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. finally he climbed down off the window. \"the show is done,\" he said. he bent to scratch ghost behind the ears. the white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \"you had best run back to your room, little sister. septa mordane will surely be lurking. the longer you hide, the sterner the penance. you\\'ll be sewing all through winter. when the spring thaw comes, they will fi', 'nd your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\"\\n\\n\\narya didn\\'t think it was funny. \"i hate needlework!\" she said with passion. \"it\\'s not fair!\"\\n\\n\\n\"nothing is fair,\" jon said. he messed up her hair again and walked away from her, ghost moving silently beside him. nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that arya was not coming.\\n\\n\\nreluctantly she turned in the other direction.\\n\\n\\nit was worse than jon had thought. it wasn\\'t septa mordane wai', \"ting in her room. it was septa mordane and her mother.\\n\\nbran\\n\\n\\nthe hunt left at dawn. the king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. prince joffrey rode with his father, so robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. uncle benjen, jory, theon greyjoy, ser rodrik, and even the queen's funny little brother had all ridden out with them. it was the last hunt, after all. on the morrow they left for the south.\\n\\n\\nbran had been left behind with jon and the girls and rickon. but rickon was only a\", \" baby and the girls were only girls and jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. bran did not look for him very hard. he thought jon was angry at him. jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. bran did not know why. he was going with uncle ben to the wall, to join the night's watch. that was almost as good as going south with the king. robb was the one they were leaving behind, not jon.\\n\\n\\nfor days, bran could scarcely wait to be off. he was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his ow\", \"n, not a pony but a real horse. his father would be the hand of the king, and they were going to live in the red castle at king's landing, the castle the dragonlords had built. old nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. it gave bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. how could he be afraid? his father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.\\n\\n\\nbran was going to be a knight \", \"himself someday, one of the kingsguard. old nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. there were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. bran knew all the stories. their names were like music to him. serwyn of the mirror shield. ser ryam redwyne. prince aemon the dragonknight. the twins ser erryk and ser arryk, who had died on one another's swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the si\", 'ngers called the dance of the dragons. the white bull, gerold hightower. ser arthur dayne, the sword of the morning. barristan the bold.\\n\\n\\ntwo of the kingsguard had come north with king robert. bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. ser boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and ser meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. ser jaime lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the kingsguard too, but robb said he had kill', \"ed the old mad king and shouldn't count anymore. the greatest living knight was ser barristan selmy, barristan the bold, the lord commander of the kingsguard. father had promised that they would meet ser barristan when they reached king's landing, and bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.\\n\\n\\nyet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly bran felt lost. winterfell had been the only home he ha\", 'd ever known. his father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. after the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, old nan and gage the cook, mikken in his smithy, hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \"hodor,\" the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . .\\n\\n\\nbut it was no good. he ', \"had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn't his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden bran just wanted to sit down and cry. he turned and ran off before hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. that was the end of his farewells. instead bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. the wolfling was smarter than any of the hou\", \"nds in his father's kennel and bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.\\n\\n\\nhe was still trying to decide on a name. robb was calling his grey wind, because he ran so fast. sansa had named hers lady, and arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little rickon called his shaggydog, which bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. jon's wolf, the white one, was ghost. bran wished he had th\", \"ought of that first, even though his wolf wasn't white. he had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.\\n\\n\\nfinally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. he hadn't been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.\\n\\n\\nhe raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. the heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, \", 'bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. his wolf came sprinting at his heels. \"you stay here,\" he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. \"lie down. that\\'s right. now stay - \"\\n\\n\\nthe wolf did as he was told. bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. he was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.\\n\\n\\nbran looked back down. his wolf fell silen', 't, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. a strange chill went through him. he began to climb again. once more the wolf howled. \"quiet,\" he yelled. \"sit down. stay. you\\'re worse than mother.\" the howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.\\n\\n\\nthe rooftops of winterfell were bran\\'s second home. his mother often said that bran could climb before he could walk. bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he cou', \"ld not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.\\n\\n\\nto a boy, winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. in the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn't even be sure what floor you were on. the place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, maester luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk\", ' deep into the earth.\\n\\n\\nwhen he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, bran could see all of winterfell in a glance. he liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the first keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless d', \"ogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. it made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even robb would never know.\\n\\n\\nit taught him winterfell's secrets too. the builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of winterfell. there was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. bran knew about that. and he \", \"knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. even maester luwin didn't know that, bran was convinced.\\n\\n\\nhis mother was terrified that one day bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. he told her that he wouldn't, but she never believed him. once she made him promise that he would stay o\", 'n the ground. he had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.\\n\\n\\nhe confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. lord eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself. guards were posted to see that bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience. the next morning bran was nowhere to be seen. they finally found him fast asleep in the upper b', 'ranches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.\\n\\n\\nas angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. \"you\\'re not my son,\" he told bran when they fetched him down, \"you\\'re a squirrel. so be it. if you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.\"\\n\\n\\nbran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others. old nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by light', \"ning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. bran was not impressed. there were crows' nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. none of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.\\n\\n\\nlater, maester luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in bran's clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to d\", 'emonstrate what would happen to bran if he fell. that had been fun, but afterward bran just looked at the maester and said, \"i\\'m not made of clay. and anyhow, i never fall.\"\\n\\n\\nthen for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down. that was the best time of all. it was like playing a game with his brothers, except that bran always won. none of the guards could climb half so well as bran, not even jory. most of the time they never saw him anyway. ', 'people never looked up. that was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.\\n\\n\\nhe liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between . he always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. he liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. he liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter p', \"each. he liked the birds: the crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. bran knew them all.\\n\\n\\nmost of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. it made the whole castle bran's secret place.\\n\\n\\nhis favorite haunt was the broken tower. once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in winterfell\", '. a long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. the top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. but no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for bran and the crows.\\n\\n\\nhe knew two ways to get there. you co', \"uld climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and bran never liked to put his full weight on them.\\n\\n\\nthe best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn't hear you overhead. that brought you up to the blind side of the first keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was\", ' taller than it looked. only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. you could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. from there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close. the last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then t', 'he crows would come round to see if you\\'d brought any corn.\\n\\n\\nbran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. he was so startled he almost lost his grip. the first keep had been empty all his life.\\n\\n\\n\"i do not like it,\" a woman was saying. there was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. \"you should be the hand.\"\\n\\n\\n\"gods forbid,\" a man\\'s voice replied lazily. \"it\\'s not an honor i\\'d want. the', 're\\'s far too much work involved.\"\\n\\n\\nbran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. they might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by.\\n\\n\\n\"don\\'t you see the danger this puts us in?\" the woman said. \"robert loves the man like a brother.\"\\n\\n\"robert can barely stomach his brothers. not that i blame him. stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion.\"\\n\\n\\n\"don\\'t play the fool. stannis and renly are one thing, and eddard stark is quite another. robert will listen to stark. damn them both. i should', ' have insisted that he name you, but i was certain stark would refuse him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"we ought to count ourselves fortunate,\" the man said. \"the king might as easily have named one of his brothers, or even littlefinger, gods help us. give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and i\\'ll sleep more easily by night.\"\\n\\n\\nthey were talking about father, bran realized. he wanted to hear more. a few more feet . . . but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window.\\n\\n\\n\"we will have to watc', 'h him carefully,\" the woman said.\\n\\n\\n\"i would sooner watch you,\" the man said. he sounded bored. \"come back here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"lord eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the neck,\" the woman said. \"never. i tell you, he means to move against us. why else would he leave the seat of his power?\"\\n\\n\\n\"a hundred reasons. duty. honor. he yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get away from his wife, or both. perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his l', 'ife.\"\\n\\n\\n\"his wife is lady arryn\\'s sister. it\\'s a wonder lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.\"\\n\\n\\nbran looked down. there was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. he tried to lower himself toward it. too far. he would never reach.\\n\\n\\n\"you fret too much. lysa arryn is a frightened cow.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that frightened cow shared jon arryn\\'s bed.\"\\n\\n\\n\"if she knew anything, she would have gone to robert before she fled king\\'s landing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"when he had already agreed to foster tha', 't weakling son of hers at casterly rock? i think not. she knew the boy\\'s life would be hostage to her silence. she may grow bolder now that he\\'s safe atop the eyrie.\"\\n\\n\\n\"mothers.\" the man made the word sound like a curse. \"i think birthing does something to your minds. you are all mad.\" he laughed. it was a bitter sound. \"let lady arryn grow as bold as she likes. whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.\" he paused a moment. \"or does she?\"\\n\\n\\n\"do you think the king will', ' require proof?\" the woman said. \"i tell you, he loves me not.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and whose fault is that, sweet sister?\"\\n\\n\\nbran studied the ledge. he could drop down. it was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up . . . except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. he was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears.\\n\\n\\n\"you are as blind as robert,\" the woman was saying.\\n\\n\\n\"if you mean i see the same thing, yes,\" the man said. \"i ', 'see a man who would sooner die than betray his king.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?\" the woman said. \"oh, i don\\'t deny he\\'s loyal to robert, that\\'s obvious. what happens when robert dies and joff takes the throne? and the sooner that comes to pass, the safer we\\'ll all be. my husband grows more restless every day. having stark beside him will only make him worse. he\\'s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. how long till he decides to put me a', 'side for some new lyanna?\"\\n\\n\\nbran was suddenly very frightened. he wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to find his brothers. only what would he tell them? he had to get closer, bran realized. he had to see who was talking.\\n\\n\\nthe man sighed. \"you should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.\"\\n\\n\\n\"stop that!\" the woman said. bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man\\'s laughter.\\n\\n\\nbran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, cra', 'wled out onto the roof. this was the easy way. he moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking.\\n\\n\\n\"all this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,\" the man said. \"come here and be quiet.\"\\n\\n\\nbran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. he hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. the world looked strange upside down. a courtyard swam dizzily below him, its ', \"stones still wet with melted snow.\\n\\n\\nbran looked in the window.\\n\\n\\ninside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. they were both naked. bran could not tell who they were. the man's back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall.\\n\\n\\nthere were soft, wet sounds. bran realized they were kissing. he watched, wide-eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. the man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, beca\", 'use the woman started to moan, low in her throat. \"stop it,\" she said, \"stop it, stop it. oh, please . . . \" but her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.\\n\\n\\nbran saw her face. her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen.\\n\\n\\nhe must have made a noise. suddenly ', \"her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. she screamed.\\n\\n\\neverything happened at once then. ' the woman pushed the man away wildly, shouting and pointing. bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. he was in too much of a hurry. his hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. there was an instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. he shot out a hand, grabbed for the \", 'ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. he swung against the building, hard. the impact took the breath out of him. bran dangled, one-handed, panting.\\n\\n\\nfaces appeared in the window above him.\\n\\n\\nthe queen. and now bran recognized the man beside her. they looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror.\\n\\n\\n\"he saw us,\" the woman said shrilly.\\n\\n\\n\"so he did,\" the man said.\\n\\n\\nbran\\'s fingers started to slip. he grabbed the ledge with his other hand. fingernails dug into unyielding stone. ', 'the man reached down. \"take my hand,\" he said. \"before you fall.\"\\n\\n\\nbran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. the man yanked him up to the ledge. \"what are you doing?\" the woman demanded.\\n\\n\\nthe man ignored her. he was very strong. he stood bran up on the sill. \"how old are you, boy?\"\\n\\n\\n\"seven,\" bran said, shaking with relief. his fingers had dug deep gouges in the man\\'s forearm. he let go sheepishly.\\n\\n\\nthe man looked over at the woman. \"the things i do for love,\" he said with ', 'loathing. he gave bran a shove.\\n\\n\\nscreaming, bran went backward out the window into empty air. there was nothing to grab on to. the courtyard rushed up to meet him.\\n\\n\\nsomewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn. \\n\\ntyrion\\n\\n\\nsomewhere in the great stone maze of winterfell, a wolf howled. the sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning.\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. somet', 'hing about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running na*ed before the pack.\\n\\n\\nwhen the direwolf howled again, tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. he covered a yawn with the back of his hand. his reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. he had been at it ', 'all night, but that was nothing new. tyrion lannister was not much a one for sleeping.\\n\\n\\nhis legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. he massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in front of him. tyrion glanced at the title. a life of the grand maester aethelmure, no wonder. \"chayle,\" he said softly. the young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly o', 'n its silver chain. \"i\\'m off to break my fast. see that you return the books to the shelves. be gentle with the valyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. ayrmidon\\'s engines of war is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy i\\'ve ever seen.\" chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. patiently, tyrion repeated his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks.\\n\\n\\noutside, tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of ', 'the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. it was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. the rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. sandor clegane\\'s rasping voice drifted up to him. \"the boy is a long time dying. i wish he would be quicker about it.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion glanced down and saw the hound standing with young joffrey as squires swarmed arou', 'nd them. \"at least he dies quietly,\" the prince replied. \"it\\'s the wolf that makes the noise. i could scarce sleep last night.\"\\n\\n\\nclegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head. \"i could silence the creature, if it please you,\" he said through his open visor. his boy placed a longsword in his hand. he tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. behind him, the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel.\\n\\n\\nthe notion seemed', ' to delight the prince. \"send a dog to kill a dog!\" he exclaimed. \"winterfell is so infested with wolves, the starks would never miss one.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. \"i beg to differ, nephew,\" he said. \"the starks can count past six. unlike some princes i might name.\"\\n\\n\\njoffrey had the grace at least to blush.\\n\\n\\n\"a voice from nowhere,\" sandor said. he peered through his helm, looking this way and that. \"spirits of the air!\"\\n\\n\\nthe prince laughed, as he always laughed when h', 'is bodyguard did this mummer\\'s farce. tyrion was used to it. \"down here.\"\\n\\n\\nthe tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. \"the little lord tyrion,\" he said. \"my pardons. i did not see you standing there.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i am in no mood for your insolence today.\" tyrion turned to his nephew. \"joffrey, it is past time you called on lord eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort.\"\\n\\n\\njoffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. \"what good will my comfort do them?\"\\n\\n\\n\"no', 'ne,\" tyrion said. \"yet it is expected of you. your absence has been noted.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the stark boy is nothing to me,\" joffrey said. \"i cannot abide the wailing of women.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. the boy\\'s cheek began to redden.\\n\\n\\n\"one word,\" tyrion said, \"and i will hit you again.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m going to tell mother!\" joffrey exclaimed.\\n\\n\\ntyrion hit him again. now both cheeks flamed.\\n\\n\\n\"you tell your mother,\" tyrion told him. \"but first you get yourself to l', 'ord and lady stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with them. do you understand? do you?\"\\n\\n\\nthe boy looked as though he was going to cry. instead, he managed a weak nod. then he turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. tyrion watched him run.\\n\\n\\na shadow fell across his face. h', 'e turned to find clegane looming overhead like a cliff. his soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. he had lowered the visor on his helm. it was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over clegane\\'s hideously burned face.\\n\\n\\n\"the prince will remember that, little lord,\" the hound warned him. the helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble.\\n\\n\\n\"i pray he does,\" tyrion lannister replied. \"if he forgets, be a go', 'od dog and remind him.\" he glanced around the courtyard. \"do you know where i might find my brother?\"\\n\\n\\n\"breaking fast with the queen.\"\\n\\n\\n\"ah,\" tyrion said. he gave sandor clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him, whistling. he pitied the first knight to try the hound today. the man did have a temper.\\n\\n\\na cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the guest house. jaime sat at table with cersei and the children, talking in low, h', 'ushed voices.\\n\\n\\n\"is robert still abed?\" tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table.\\n\\n\\nhis sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born . \"the king has not slept at all,\" she told him. \"he is with lord eddard. he has taken their sorrow deeply to heart.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he has a large heart, our robert,\" jaime said with a lazy smile. there was very little that jaime took seriously. tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it. duri', 'ng all the terrible long years of his childhood, only jaime had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything.\\n\\n\\na servant approached. \"bread,\" tyrion told him, \"and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down. oh, and some bacon. burn it until it turns black.\" the man bowed and moved off. tyrion turned back to his siblings. twins, male and female. they looked very much the part this morn', 'ing. both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats.\\n\\n\\ntyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather not know. bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate.\\n\\n\\nprince tommen spoke up. \"do you have news of bran, uncle?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i stopped by the sickroom last night,\" tyrion announced. ', '\"there was no change. the maester thought that a hopeful sign.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t want brandon to die,\" tommen said timorously. he was a sweet boy. not like his brother, but then jaime and tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves.\\n\\n\\n\"lord eddard had a brother named brandon as well,\" jaime mused. \"one of the hostages murdered by targaryen. it seems to be an unlucky name.\"\\n\\n\"oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,\" tyrion said. the servant brought his plate. he ripped off a chunk of black ', 'bread.\\n\\n\\ncersei was studying him warily. \"what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion gave her a crooked smile. \"why, only that tommen may get his wish. the maester thinks the boy may yet live.\" he took a sip of beer.\\n\\n\\nmyrcella gave a happy gasp, and tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children tyrion was watching. the glance that passed between jaime and cersei lasted no more than a second, but he did not miss it. then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. \"that is no mercy. these northern gods ar', 'e cruel to let the child linger in such pain.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what were the maester\\'s words?\" jaime asked.\\n\\n\\nthe bacon crunched when he bit into it. tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, \"he thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. it has been four days with no change.\"\\n\\n\\n\"will bran get better, uncle?\" little myrcella asked. she had all of her mother\\'s beauty, and none of her nature.\\n\\n\\n\"his back is broken, little one,\" tyrion told her. \"the fall shattered his legs', ' as well. they keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death. perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.\"\\n\\n\\n\"if he wakes,\" cersei repeated. \"is that likely?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the gods alone know,\" tyrion told her. \"the maester only hopes.\" he chewed some more bread. \"i would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. the creature is outside his window day and night, howling. every time they chase it away, it returns. the maester said they clo', 'sed the window once, to shut out the noise, and bran seemed to weaken. when they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.\"\\n\\n\\nthe queen shuddered. \"there is something unnatural about those animals,\" she said. \"they are dangerous. i will not have any of them coming south with us.\"\\n\\n\\njaime said, \"you\\'ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. they follow those girls everywhere.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion started on his fish. \"are you leaving soon, then?\"\\n\\n\\n\"not near soon enough,\" cersei said. then she frowned. \"ar', 'e we leaving?\" she echoed. \"what about you? gods, don\\'t tell me you are staying here?\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion shrugged. \"benjen stark is returning to the night\\'s watch with his brother\\'s bastard. i have a mind to go with them and see this wall we have all heard so much of.\"\\n\\n\\njaime smiled. \"i hope you\\'re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion laughed. \"what, me, celibate? the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock. no, i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off', ' the edge of the world.\"\\n\\n\\ncersei stood abruptly. \"the children don\\'t need to hear this filth. tommen, myrcella, come.\" she strode briskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing behind her.\\n\\n\\njaime lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. \"stark will never consent to leave winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he will if robert commands it,\" tyrion said. \"and robert will command it. there is nothing lord eddard can do for the', ' boy in any case.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he could end his torment,\" jaime said. \"i would, if it were my son. it would be a mercy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i advise against putting that suggestion to lord eddard, sweet brother,\" tyrion said. \"he would not take it kindly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. worse than a cripple. a grotesque. give me a good clean death.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. \"speaking for the grotesques,\" he said, \"i beg to differ. death is so terribl', 'y final, while life is full of possibilities.\"\\n\\n\\njaime smiled. \"you are a perverse little imp, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh, yes,\" tyrion admitted. \"i hope the boy does wake. i would be most interested to hear what he might have to say.\"\\n\\n\\nhis brother\\'s smile curdled like sour milk. \"tyrion, my sweet brother,\" he said darkly, \"there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion\\'s mouth was full of bread and fish. he took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, and', ' grinned up wolfishly at jaime, \"why, jaime, my sweet brother,\" he said, \"you wound me. you know how much i love my family.\"\\n\\n\\njon\\n\\n\\njon climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever. ghost padded silently beside him. outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet. too quiet for jon\\'s liking.\\n\\n\\nhe reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. ghost ', \"nuzzled at his hand. he took courage from that. he straightened, and entered the room.\\n\\n\\nlady stark was there beside his bed. she had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight. not for a moment had she left bran's side. she had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all. she fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life. not once did she leave the room. so jon h\", 'ad stayed away.\\n\\n\\nbut now there was no more time.\\n\\n\\nhe stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. the window was open. below, a wolf howled. ghost heard and lifted his head.\\n\\n\\nlady stark looked over. for a moment she did not seem to recognize him. finally she blinked. \"what are you doing here?\" she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless.\\n\\n\\n\"i came to see bran,\" jon said. \"to say good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\nher face did not change. her long auburn hair was dull and tangled.', ' she looked as though she had aged twenty years. \"you\\'ve said it. now go away.\"\\n\\n\\npart of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see bran again. he took a nervous step into the room. \"please,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nsomething cold moved in her eyes. \"i told you to leave,\" she said. \"we don\\'t want you here.\"\\n\\n\\nonce that would have sent him running. once that might even have made him cry. now it only made him angry. he would be a sworn brother of the night\\'s watch soon, and face wo', 'rse dangers than catelyn tully stark. \"he\\'s my brother,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"shall i call the guards?\"\\n\\n\\n\"call them,\" jon said, defiant. \"you can\\'t stop me from seeing him.\" he crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on bran where he lay.\\n\\n\\nshe was holding one of his hands. it looked like a claw. this was not the bran he remembered. the flesh had all gone from him. his skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made jon sick. his ey', 'es were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. the fall had shrunken him somehow. he looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave.\\n\\n\\nyet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath.\\n\\n\\n\"bran,\" he said, \"i\\'m sorry i didn\\'t come before. i was afraid.\" he could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks. jon no longer cared. \"don\\'t die, bran. please. we\\'re all waiting for you to wake up. me and robb ', 'and the girls, everyone . . . \"\\n\\n\\nlady stark was watching. she had not raised a cry. jon took that for acceptance. outside the window, the direwolf howled again. the wolf that bran had not had time to name.\\n\\n\\n\"i have to go now,\" jon said. \"uncle benjen is waiting. i\\'m to go north to the wall. we have to leave today, before the snows come.\" he remembered how excited bran had been at the prospect of the journey. it was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this. jon brush', 'ed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips.\\n\\n\\n\"i wanted him to stay here with me,\" lady stark said softly.\\n\\n\\njon watched her, wary. she was not even looking at him. she was talking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room.\\n\\n\\n\"i prayed for it,\" she said dully. \"he was my special boy. i went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that ned would change his mind and leave him here with me. sometimes prayers are', ' answered.\"\\n\\n\\njon did not know what to say. \"it wasn\\'t your fault,\" he managed after an awkward silence.\\n\\n\\nher eyes found him. they were full of poison. \"i need none of your absolution, bastard.\"\\n\\n\\njon lowered his eyes. she was cradling one of bran\\'s hands. he took the other, squeezed it. fingers like the bones of birds. \"good-bye,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nhe was at the door when she called out to him. \"jon,\" she said. he should have kept going, but she had never called him by his name before. he turned to f', 'ind her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time.\\n\\n\\n\"yes?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"it should have been you,\" she told him. then she turned back to bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. jon had never seen her cry before.\\n\\n\\nit was a long walk down to the yard.\\n\\n\\noutside, everything was noise and confusion. wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables. a light snow had begun to fall, and everyone wa', 's in an uproar to be off.\\n\\n\\nrobb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. he seemed to have grown of late, as if bran\\'s fall and his mother\\'s collapse had somehow made him stronger. grey wind was at his side.\\n\\n\\n\"uncle benjen is looking for you,\" he told jon. \"he wanted to be gone an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i know,\" jon said. \"soon.\" he looked around at all the noise and confusion. \"leaving is harder than i thought.\"\\n\\n\\n\"for me too,\" robb said. he had snow in his hair, melting from ', 'the heat of his body. \"did you see him?\"\\n\\n\\njon nodded, not trusting himself to speak .\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s not going to die,\" robb said. \"i know it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you starks are hard to kill,\" jon agreed. his voice was flat and tired. the visit had taken all the strength from him.\\n\\n\\nrobb knew something was wrong. \"my mother . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"she was . . . very kind,\" jon told him.\\n\\n\\nrobb looked relieved. \"good.\" he smiled. \"the next time i see you, you\\'ll be all in black.\"\\n\\n\\njon forced himself to smile back. \"it was always ', 'my color. how long do you think it will be?\"\\n\\n\\n\"soon enough,\" robb promised. he pulled jon to him and embraced him fiercely. \"farewell, snow.\"\\n\\n\\njon hugged him back. \"and you, stark. take care of bran.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i will.\" they broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. \"uncle benjen said to send you to the stables if i saw you,\" robb finally said.\\n\\n\\n\"i have one more farewell to make,\" jon told him.\\n\\n\\n\"then i haven\\'t seen you,\" robb replied. jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wa', 'gons and wolves and horses. it was a short walk to the armory. he picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the keep.\\n\\n\\narya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was. nymeria was helping. arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. but when she smelled ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them.\\n\\n\\narya glanced behind her, saw jon, and jumpe', 'd to her feet. she threw her skinny arms tight around his neck. \"i was afraid you were gone,\" she said, her breath catching in her throat. \"they wouldn\\'t let me out to say good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what did you do now?\" jon was amused.\\n\\n\\narya disentangled herself from him and made a face. \"nothing. i was all packed and everything.\" she gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room. \"septa mordane says i have to do it all over. my things weren', '\\'t properly folded, she says. a proper southron lady doesn\\'t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.\"\\n\\n\\n\"is that what you did, little sister?\"\\n\\n\\n\"well, they\\'re going to get all messed up anyway,\" she said. \"who cares how they\\'re folded?\"\\n\\n\\n\"septa mordane,\" jon told her. \"i don\\'t think she\\'d like nymeria helping, either.\" the she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes. \"it\\'s just as well. i have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed ver', 'y carefully.\"\\n\\n\\nher face lit up. \"a present?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you could call it that. close the door.\"\\n\\n\\nwary but excited, arya checked the hall. \"nymeria, here. guard.\" she left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door. by then jon had pulled off the rags he\\'d wrapped it in. he held it out to her.\\n\\n\\narya\\'s eyes went wide. dark eyes, like his. \"a sword,\" she said in a small, hushed breath.\\n\\n\\nthe scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see ', 'the deep blue sheen of the steel. \"this is no toy,\" he told her. \"be careful you don\\'t cut yourself. the edges are sharp enough to shave with.\"\\n\\n\\n\"girls don\\'t shave,\" arya said.\\n\\n\\n\"maybe they should. have you ever seen the septa\\'s legs?\"\\n\\n\\nshe giggled at him. \"it\\'s so skinny.\"\\n\\n\\n\"so are you,\" jon told her. \"i had mikken make this special. the bravos use swords like this in pentos and myr and the other free cities. it won\\'t hack a man\\'s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you\\'re fast e', 'nough.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i can be fast,\" arya said.\\n\\n\\n\"you\\'ll have to work at it every day.\" he put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back. \"how does it feel? do you like the balance?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i think so,\" arya said.\\n\\n\\n\"first lesson,\" jon said. \"stick them with the pointy end.\"\\n\\n\\narya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. the blow stung, but jon found himself grinning like an idiot. \"i know which end to use,\" arya said. a doubtful look crossed her face. \"septa mordane ', 'will take it away from me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"not if she doesn\\'t know you have it,\" jon said.\\n\\n\\n\"who will i practice with?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you\\'ll find someone,\" jon promised her. \"king\\'s landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of winterfell. until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. run, and ride, make yourself strong. and whatever you do . . . \"\\n\\n\\narya knew what was coming next. they said it together.\\n\\n\\n\" . . . don\\'t . . . tell . . . sansa!\"\\n\\njon messed up her hair. \"i will miss you, little si', 'ster.\"\\n\\n\\nsuddenly she looked like she was going to cry. \"i wish you were coming with us.\"\\n\\n\\n\"different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. who knows?\" he was feeling better now. he was not going to let himself be sad. \"i better go. i\\'ll spend my first year on the wall emptying chamber pots if i keep uncle ben waiting any longer.\"\\n\\n\\narya ran to him for a last hug. \"put down the sword first,\" jon warned her, laughing. she set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses.\\n\\n\\nwhen he turne', 'd back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. \"i almost forgot,\" he told her. \"all the best swords have names.\"\\n\\n\\n\"like ice,\" she said. she looked at the blade in her hand. \"does this have a name? oh, tell me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"can\\'t you guess?\" jon teased. \"your very favorite thing.\"\\n\\n\\narya seemed puzzled at first. then it came to her. she was that quick. they said it together:\\n\\n\\n\"needle!\"\\n\\n\\nthe memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.\\n\\ndaenerys\\n\\n\\ndaenerys targaryen we', \"d khal drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of pentos, for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man's life must be done beneath the open sky.\\n\\n\\ndrogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of pentos more\", ' anxious with every passing day.\\n\\n\\n\"my fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard,\" illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been drogo\\'s. the khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to daenerys and her brother until the wedding.\\n\\n\\n\"best we get princess daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of pentos away to sellswords and bravos,\" ser jorah mormont jested. the exile had offered her brother ', 'his sword the night dany had been sold to kbal drogo; viserys had accepted eagerly. mormont had been their constant companion ever since.\\n\\n\\nmagister illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but viserys did not so much as smile. \"he can have her tomorrow, if he likes,\" her brother said. he glanced over at dany, and she lowered her eyes. \"so long as he pays the price.\"\\n\\n\\nillyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. \"i have told you, all is settled. trust m', 'e. the khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes, but when?\"\\n\\n\\n\"when the khal chooses,\" illyrio said. \"he will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at vaes dothrak. after that, perhaps. if the omens favor war.\"\\n\\n\\nviserys seethed with impatience. \"i piss on dothraki omens. the usurper sits on my father\\'s throne. how long must i wait?\"\\n\\n\\nillyrio gave a massive shrug. \"you have waited most o', 'f your life, great king. what is another few months, another few years?\"\\n\\n\\nser jorah, who had traveled as far east as vaes dothrak, nodded in agreement. \"i counsel you to be patient, your grace. the dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. a lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him.\"\\n\\n\\nviserys bristled. \"guard your tongue, mormont, or i\\'ll have it out. i am no lesser man, i am the rightful lord of the seven kingdoms. the dragon ', 'does not beg.\"\\n\\n\\nser jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck. honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. there are no more dragons, dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud.\\n\\n\\nyet that night she dreamt of one. viserys was hitting her, hurting her. she was naked, clumsy with fear. she ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. he struck ', 'her again. she stumbled and fell. \"you woke the dragon,\" he screamed as he kicked her. \"you woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\" her thighs were slick with blood. she closed her eyes and whimpered. as if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. when she looked again, viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. it turned its great head slowly. when its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and c', 'overed with a fine sheen of sweat. she had never been so afraid . . .. . . until the day of her wedding came at last.\\n\\n\\nthe ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting. a mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there dany was seated beside khal drogo, above the seething sea of dothraki. she had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening. the horselords might put on rich fabrics an', \"d sweet perfumes when they visited the free cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. they gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare's milk and illyrio's fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their vo\", \"ices harsh and alien in dany's ears.\\n\\n\\nviserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest. illyrio and ser jorah sat beside him. theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal's own bloodriders, but dany could see the anger in her brother's lilac eyes. he did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they refused. he could do nothing bu\", 't nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.\\n\\n\\ndany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. she did her best to hide them, knowing how angry viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how khal drogo might react. food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick blac', 'k sausages and dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of pentos, but she waved it all away. her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.\\n\\n\\nthere was no one to talk to. khal drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at dany beside him. they had no common language. dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the ba', 'stard valyrian of the free cities, and none at all of the common tongue of the seven kingdoms. she would even have welcomed the conversation of illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.\\n\\n\\nso she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. i am blood of the dragon, she told herself. i am daenerys stormborn, princess of dragonstone, of the blood and seed of aegon the conqueror.\\n\\n\\nthe sun was only a quarter of the way ', 'up the sky when she saw her first man die. drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. drogo watched without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.\\n\\n\\nthe warriors were watching too. one of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. illyrio had told her that might happe', 'n. \"the dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. there is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.\"\\n\\n\\ndany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. then two men seized the same woman. she heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. a dance', \" of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. no one made a move to interfere.\\n\\n\\nit ended as quickly as it began. the arakhs shivered together faster than dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. steel bit into flesh just above the dothraki's waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. as the loser died,\", ' the winner took hold of the nearest woman - not even the one they had been quarreling over - and had her there and then. slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.\\n\\n\\nmagister illyrio had warned dany about this too. \"a dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,\" he had said. her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.\\n\\n\\nas the hours passed, the terror grew in dany, until it was all she could do not to screa', 'm. she was afraid of the dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all. she was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask.\\n\\n\\ni am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again.\\n\\n\\nwhen at last the sun was low in th', 'e sky, khal drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. drogo stood and pulled dany to her feet beside him. it was time for her bride gifts.\\n\\n\\nand after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage. dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her. she hugged herself to try to keep from shaking.\\n\\n\\nher brother viserys gifted her with three handmaids', '. dany knew they had cost him nothing; illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. irri and jhiqui were copper-skinned dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes, doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed lysene girl. \"these are no common servants, sweet sister,\" her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. \"illyrio and i selected them personally for you. irri will teach you riding, jhiqui the dothraki tongue, and doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love.\" he smiled thinly. ', '\"she\\'s very good, illyrio and i can both swear to that.\"\\n\\n\\nser jorah mormont apologized for his gift. \"it is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford,\" he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. they were histories and songs of the seven kingdoms, she saw, written in the common tongue. she thanked him with all her heart.\\n\\n\\nmagister illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. when ', 'she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the free cities could produce . . . and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. dany gasped. they were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. she lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate ena', 'mel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. the surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. one egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how dany turned it. another was pale cream streaked with gold. the last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and sw', 'irls. \"what are they?\" she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.\\n\\n\\n\"dragon\\'s eggs, from the shadow lands beyond asshai,\" said magister illyrio. \"the eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i shall treasure them always.\" dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. it was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that illyrio could afford to be lavish. he had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part i', 'n selling her to khal drogo.\\n\\n\\nthe khal\\'s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were. haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. magister illyrio and ser jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings. \"this is a gift worthy of a great warrior, o blood of my blood, and i am but a woman. let my lord husband bear thes', 'e in my stead.\" and so khal drogo too received his \"bride gifts.\"\\n\\n\\nother gifts she was given in plenty by other dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. \"a handsome gift, khaleesi,\" magister illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. \"most lucky.\" the gifts mounted up around he', 'r in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.\\n\\n\\nand last of all, khal drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. an expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. when he returned, the dense press of dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her.\\n\\n\\nshe was a young filly, spirited and splendid. dany knew just enough about horses to know t', 'hat this was no ordinary animal. there was something about her that took the breath away. she was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke.\\n\\n\\nhesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse\\'s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. khal drogo said something in dothraki and magister illyrio translated. \"silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.\"\\n\\n\\n\"she\\'s beautiful,\" dany murmured.\\n\\n\\n\"she is the pride of the khalasar, \" illyrio said. \"custom decrees that the kh', 'aleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal.\"\\n\\n\\ndrogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. he lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to. dany sat there uncertain for a moment. no one had told her about this part. \"what should i do?\" she asked illyrio.\\n\\nit was ser jorah mormont who answered. \"take the reins and ride. you need not go far.\"\\n\\n\\nnervously dany gathered the re', 'ins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. she was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees.\\n\\n\\nand for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. or perhaps it was for the first time ever.\\n\\n\\nthe silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, eve', 'ry eye upon them. dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. the horse broke into a trot, and she smiled. dothraki scrambled to clear a path. the slightest pressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. she sent it into a gallop, and now the dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. as she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path', '. they were hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop. a daring she had never known filled daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head.\\n\\n\\nthe silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings.\\n\\n\\nwhen she pulled up before magister illyrio, she said, \"tell khal drogo that he has given me the wind.\" the fat pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in dothraki, and dany saw her new husband smile for the first time.\\n\\n\\nthe last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of ', 'pentos to the west just then. dany had lost all track of time. khal drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. as the khal was saddling the horse, viserys slid close to dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, \"please him, sweet sister, or i swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before.\"\\n\\n\\nthe fear came back to her then, with her brother\\'s words. she felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready ', 'for what was about to happen to her.\\n\\n\\nthey rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind. khal drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. the tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. \"i am the blood of the dragon,\" she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage up. \"i am the blood of the dragon. i am the blood of the dragon.\" the dragon was never afraid.\\n\\n\\nafterwar', 'd she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers. she felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. she stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to cry.\\n\\n\\nkhal drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. \"no,\" he said. he l', 'ifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb.\\n\\n\\n\"you speak the common tongue,\" dany said in wonder.\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" he said again.\\n\\n\\nperhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better. drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in dothraki. dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a tenderness she ha', 'd never expected from this man.\\n\\n\\nhe put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone. taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces finally at a height. \"no,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"is that the only word you know?\" she asked him.\\n\\n\\ndrogo did not reply. his long heavy braid was coiled in t', 'he dirt beside him. he pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. after a moment dany leaned forward to help. when they were done, drogo gestured. she understood. slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid.\\n\\n\\nit took a long time. all the while he sat there silently, watching her. when she was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. she had never seen hair so long, so black, so th', 'ick.\\n\\n\\nthen it was his turn. he began to undress her.\\n\\n\\nhis fingers were deft and strangely tender. he removed her silks one by one, carefully, while dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. when he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. she averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. \"no,\" drogo said. he pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. \"no,\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" she echoed back at him.\\n\\n', '\\nhe stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. the night air was chilly on her bare skin. she shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. she was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. khal drogo sat with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes.\\n\\n\\nafter a while he began to touch her. lightly at first, then harder. she could sense the fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. he held her hand i', 'n his own and brushed her fingers, one by one. he ran a hand gently down her leg. he stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. he put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. he turned her around, massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.\\n\\n\\nit seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. he stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. he circled her ni**les with his thumbs, pi', 'nched them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her ni**les stiffened and began to ache.\\n\\n\\nhe stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. he cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. \"no?\" he said, and she knew it was a question.\\n\\n\\nshe took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. \"yes,\" she whispered as she put his f', 'inger inside her.\\n\\n\\neddard\\n\\n\\nthe summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey.\\n\\n\\nalyn shook him roughly from his dreams and ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted. robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. \"up, stark!\" he roared. \"up, up! we have matters of state to discuss.\"\\n\\n\\n\"by all means,', '\" ned said. \"come inside, your grace.\" alyn lifted the flap of the tent.\\n\\n\\n\"no, no, no,\" robert said. his breath steamed with every word. \"the camp is full of ears. besides, i want to ride out and taste this country of yours.\" ser boros and ser meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, ned saw. there was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.\\n\\n\\nrobert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as ned galloped along beside him, trying to keep up. he call', 'ed out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not hear him. after that ned rode in silence. they soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. by then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still robert would not slow.\\n\\n\\ndawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. by then they were miles south of the main party. robert was flushed and exhilarated as ned reined up beside h', 'im. \"gods,\" he swore, laughing, \"it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride! i swear, ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad.\" he had never been a patient man, robert baratheon. \"that damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain . . . i promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, i\\'m going to burn it, and cersei can walk!\"\\n\\n\\nned laughed. \"i will gladly light the torch for you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"go', 'od man!\" the king clapped him on the shoulder. \"i\\'ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going.\"\\n\\n\\na smile touched ned\\'s lips. \"i do believe you mean it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i do, i do,\" the king said. \"what do you say, ned? just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer\\'s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.\"\\n\\n\\n\"would that we could,\" ned said, \"but we have duties now, my liege . . . to the ', 'realm, to our children, i to my lady wife and you to your queen. we are not the boys we were.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you were never the boy you were,\" robert grumbled. \"more\\'s the pity. and yet there was that one time . . . what was her name, that common girl of yours? becca? no, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. yours was . . . aleena? no. you told me once. was it merryl? you know the one i mean, your bastard\\'s mother?\"\\n\\n\\n\"her name was wylla,\" ned re', 'plied with cool courtesy, \"and i would sooner not speak of her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"wylla. yes.\" the king grinned. \"she must have been a rare wench if she could make lord eddard stark forget his honor, even for an hour. you never told me what she looked like . . . \"\\n\\n\\nned\\'s mouth tightened in anger. \"nor will i. leave it be, robert, for the love you say you bear me. i dishonored myself and i dishonored catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.\"\\n\\n\\n\"gods have mercy, you scarcely knew catelyn.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i had taken her to ', 'wife. she was carrying my child.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you are too hard on yourself, ned. you always were. damn it, no woman wants baelor the blessed in her bed.\" he slapped a hand on his knee. \"well, i\\'ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though i swear, at times you\\'re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.\"\\n\\n\\nthe rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. a wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long,', ' low hummocks. ned pointed them out to his king. \"the barrows of the first men.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert frowned. \"have we ridden onto a graveyard?\"\\n\\n\\n\"there are barrows everywhere in the north, your grace,\" ned told him. \"this land is old.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and cold,\" robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. the guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. \"well, i did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. there was a rider in the night, from lord', ' varys in king\\'s landing. here.\" the king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to ned.\\n\\n\\nvarys the eunuch was the king\\'s master of whisperers. he served robert now as he had once served aerys targaryen. ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern lady arryn. \"what is the source for this information?\"\\n\\n\\n\"do you remember ser jorah mormont?\"\\n\\n\\n\"would that i might forget him,\" ned said bluntly. the mormonts of bear isla', 'nd were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. ser jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a tyroshi slaver. as the mormonts were bannermen to the starks, his crime had dishonored the north. ned had made the long journey west to bearisland, only to find when he arrived that jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of ice and the king\\'s justice. five years had passed since then.\\n\\n\\n\"ser jorah is now in pentos, anxious to earn', ' a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,\" robert explained. \"lord varys makes good use of him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"so the slaver has become a spy,\" ned said with distaste. he handed the letter back. \"i would rather he become a corpse.\"\\n\\n\\n\"varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,\" robert said. \"jorah aside, what do you make of his report?\"\\n\\n\\n\"daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord. what of it? shall we send her a wedding gift?\"\\n\\n\\nthe king frowned. \"a knife, perhaps. a', ' good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.\"\\n\\n\\nned did not feign surprise; robert\\'s hatred of the targaryens was a madness in him. he remembered the angry words they had exchanged when tywin lannister had presented robert with the corpses of rhaegar\\'s wife and children as a token of fealty. ned had named that murder; robert called it war. when he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, \"i see no babes. only dragonspawn.\" not even ', 'jon arryn had been able to calm that storm. eddard stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south. it had taken another death to reconcile them; lyanna\\'s death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.\\n\\n\\nthis time, ned resolved to keep his temper. \"your grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. you are no tywin lannister, to slaughter innocents.\" it was said that rhaegar\\'s little girl had cried as they dragged her from benea', 'th her bed to face the swords. the boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet lord tywin\\'s soldiers had torn him from his mother\\'s breast and dashed his head against a wall.\\n\\n\\n\"and how long will this one remain an innocent?\" robert\\'s mouth grew hard. \"this child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"nonetheless,\" ned said, \"the murder of children . . . it would be vile . . . unspeakable . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"unspeakable?\" the king roared. \"what aerys did ', 'to your brother brandon was unspeakable. the way your lord father died, that was unspeakable. and rhaegar . . . how many times do you think he raped your sister? how many hundreds of times?\" his voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him. the king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at ned. \"i will kill every targaryen i can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then i will piss on their graves.\"\\n\\n\\nned knew be', 'tter than to defy him when the wrath was on him. if the years had not quenched robert\\'s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. \"you can\\'t get your hands on this one, can you?\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\\nthe king\\'s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. \"no, gods be cursed. some pox-ridden pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he\\'s handed them over to the dothraki. i should have had them both killed years ago, when i', 't was easy to get at them, but jon was as bad as you. more fool i, i listened to him.\"\\n\\n\"jon arryn was a wise man and a good hand.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert snorted. the anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. \"this khal drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde . what would jon say to that?\"\\n\\n\\n\"he would say that even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea,\" ned replied calmly. \"the barbarians have no ships. they hate a', 'nd fear the open sea.\"\\n\\n\\nthe king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. \"perhaps. there are ships to be had in the free cities, though. i tell you, ned, i do not like this marriage. there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper. do you forget how many houses fought for targaryen in the war? they bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. if the beggar king crosses with a dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will ', 'join him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he will not cross,\" ned promised. \"and if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the sea. once you choose a new warden of the east - \"\\n\\n\\nthe king groaned. \"for the last time, i will not name the arryn boy warden. i know the boy is your nephew, but with targaryens climbing in bed with dothraki, i would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.\"\\n\\n\\nned was ready for that. \"yet we still must have a warden of the east. if robert arryn wi', 'll not do, name one of your brothers. stannis proved himself at the siege of storm\\'s end, surely.\"\\n\\n\\nhe let the name hang there for a moment. the king frowned and said nothing. he looked uncomfortable.\\n\\n\\n\"that is,\" ned finished quietly, watching, \"unless you have already promised the honor to another.\"\\n\\n\\nfor a moment robert had the grace to look startled. just as quickly, the look became annoyance. \"what if i have?\"\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s jaime lannister, is it not?\"\\n\\n\\nrobert kicked his horse back into motion ', 'and started down the ridge toward the barrows. ned kept pace with him. the king rode on, eyes straight ahead. \"yes,\" he said at last. a single hard word to end the matter.\\n\\n\\n\"kingslayer,\" ned said. the rumors were true, then. he rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. \"an able and courageous man, no doubt,\" he said carefully, \"but his father is warden of the west, robert. in time ser jaime will succeed to that honor. no one man should hold both east and west.\" he left unsaid his real concern; tha', 't the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of lannisters.\\n\\n\\n\"i will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,\" the king said stubbornly. \"at the moment, lord tywin looms eternal as casterly rock, so i doubt that jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. don\\'t vex me about this, ned, the stone has been set.\"\\n\\n\\n\"your grace, may i speak frankly?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i seem unable to stop you,\" robert grumbled. they rode through tall brown grasses.\\n\\n\\n\"can you trust jaime lannis', 'ter?\"\\n\\n\\n\"he is my wife\\'s twin, a sworn brother of the kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\"as they were bound to aerys targaryen\\'s,\" ned pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\"why should i mistrust him? he has done everything i have ever asked of him. his sword helped win the throne i sit on.\"\\n\\n\\nhis sword helped taint the throne you sit on, ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. \"he swore a vow to protect his king\\'s life with his own. then he opened that king\\'s thro', 'at with a sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\"seven hells, someone had to kill aerys!\" robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. \"if jaime hadn\\'t done it, it would have been left for you or me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"we were not sworn brothers of the kingsguard,\" ned said. the time had come for robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. \"do you remember the trident, your grace?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i won my crown there. how should i forget it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you took a wound from rhaegar,\" ned reminded him. \"so when th', 'e targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands. the remnants of rhaegar\\'s army fled back to king\\'s landing. we followed. aerys was in the red keep with several thousand loyalists. i expected to find the gates closed to us.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert gave an impatient shake of his head. \"instead you found that our men had already taken the city. what of it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"not our men,\" ned said patiently. \"lannister men. the lion of lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. and they had tak', 'en the city by treachery.\"\\n\\n\\nthe war had raged for close to a year. lords great and small had flocked to robert\\'s banners; others had remained loyal to targaryen. the mighty lannisters of casterly rock, the wardens of the west, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. aerys targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when lord tywin lannister appeared before the gates of king\\'s landing with an army twelve thousand strong,', ' professing loyalty. so the mad king had ordered his last mad act. he had opened his city to the lions at the gate.\\n\\n\\n\"treachery was a coin the targaryens knew well,\" robert said. the anger was building in him again. \"lannister paid them back in kind. it was no less than they deserved. i shall not trouble my sleep over it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you were not there,\" ned said, bitterness in his voice. troubled sleep was no stranger to him. he had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at nigh', 't. \"there was no honor in that conquest.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the others take your honor!\" robert swore. \"what did any targaryen ever know of honor? go down into your crypt and ask lyanna about the dragon\\'s honor!\"\\n\\n\\n\"you avenged lyanna at the trident,\" ned said, halting beside the king. promise me, ned, she had whispered.\\n\\n\\n\"that did not bring her back.\" robert looked away, off into the grey distance. \"the gods be damned. it was a hollow victory they gave me. a crown . . . it was the girl i prayed them for. you', 'r sister, safe . . . and mine again, as she was meant to be. i ask you, ned, what good is it to wear a crown? the gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i cannot answer for the gods, your grace . . . only for what i found when i rode into the throne room that day,\" ned said. \"aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. his dragon skulls stared down from the walls. lannister\\'s men were everywhere. jaime wore the white cloak of the kingsguard over his golden armor. i can', ' see him still. even his sword was gilded. he was seated on the iron throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion\\'s head. how he glittered!\"\\n\\n\\n\"this is well known,\" the king complained.\\n\\n\\n\"i was still mounted. i rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. it felt as though they were watching me, somehow. i stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. his golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king\\'s blood', '. my men were filling the room behind me. lannister\\'s men drew back. i never said a word. i looked at him seated there on the throne, and i waited. at last jaime laughed and got up. he took off his helm, and he said to me, \\'have no fear, stark. i was only keeping it warm for our friend robert. it\\'s not a very comfortable seat, i\\'m afraid.\\' \"\\n\\n\\nthe king threw back his head and roared. his laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. they took to the air in a wild beating of wing', 's. \"you think i should mistrust lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?\" he shook with laughter again. \"jaime was all of seventeen, ned. scarce more than a boy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"boy or man, he had no right to that throne.\"\\n\\n\\n\"perhaps he was tired,\" robert suggested. \"killing kings is weary work. gods know, there\\'s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room. and he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. in more ways than one.\" the king shook his head. \"well, now i know ', 'jaime\\'s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. i am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, ned. it\\'s all as tedious as counting coppers. come, let\\'s ride, you used to know how. i want to feel the wind in my hair again.\" he kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him.\\n\\n\\nfor a moment ned did not follow. he had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness. not for the first time, he wondered what', ' he was doing here and why he had come. he was no jon arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, and nothing ned could say or do would change that. he belonged in winterfell. he belonged with catelyn in her grief, and with bran.\\n\\n\\na man could not always be where he belonged, though. resigned, eddard stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king.\\n\\ntyrion\\n\\n\\nthe north went on forever.\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister knew the m', \"aps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another.\\n\\n\\nthey had left winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen's huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. the kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of ca\", 'stle and town. there the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with them, while tyrion turned north with benjen stark and his nephew.\\n\\n\\nit had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.\\n\\n\\nwest of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. to the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see. stone bridges spanned swift, na', 'rrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. the road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found.\\n\\n\\nthree days ride from winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. the flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders. when the ', 'wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.\\n\\n\\nwith the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any tyrion had ever seen. \"the wolfswood,\" benjen stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so distant. jon snow\\'s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, bu', \"t never raised his own voice in reply. there was something very unsettling about that animal, tyrion thought.\\n\\n\\nthere were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as befit a lannister. benjen stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the night's watch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one yoren. yoren was s\", 'tooped and sinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone. with him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the fingers. \"rapers,\" yoren said with a cold look at his charges. tyrion understood. life on the wall was said to be hard, but no doubt it was preferable to castration.\\n\\n\\nfive men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to benjen stark by maester luwin. no doubt they made a c', \"urious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road.\\n\\n\\ntyrion noticed jon snow watching yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. his two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel.\\n\\n\\nno doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the night's watch wa\", 's made up of men like his uncle. if so, yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. tyrion felt sorry for the boy. he had chosen a hard life . . . or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him.\\n\\n\\nhe had rather less sympathy for the uncle. benjen stark seemed to share his brother\\'s distaste for lannisters, and he had not been pleased when tyrion had told him of his intentions. \"i warn you, lannister, you\\'ll find no inns at the wall,\" he had said, looking down on him.\\n\\n\\n\"no', ' doubt you\\'ll find some place to put me,\" tyrion had replied. \"as you might have noticed, i\\'m small.\"\\n\\n\\none did not say no to the queen\\'s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but stark had not been happy. \"you will not like the ride, i promise you that,\" he\\'d said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise.\\n\\n\\nby the end of the first week, tyrion\\'s thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were cramping badly, and he was chilled ', \"to the bone. he did not complain. he was damned if he would give benjen stark that satisfaction.\\n\\n\\nhe took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. stark had offered it to him in an excess of night's watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously decline. tyrion had accepted with a smile. he had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. it was cold u\", 'p here, and growing colder. the nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. by now stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. perhaps he had learned a lesson. the lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. the lannisters took what was offered.\\n\\n\\nfarms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more ro', 'ofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources.\\n\\n\\ntyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. so while stark and yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read.\\n\\n\\non the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the summer isles that he had brought all the way north from', \" casterly rock, and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. with lord eddard stark's permission, tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the winterfell library and packed them for the ride north.\\n\\nhe found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. a grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the win\", \"e, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him. it is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the dothraki, and small wonder. an archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow.\\n\\n\\ntyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. when he had first come to king's landing for his sister's wedding to robert baratheon, he had made it a \", \"point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of targaryen's throne room. king robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored.\\n\\n\\nhe had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. he had not thought to find them beautiful. yet they were. as black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. they liked the fire, he sensed. h\", \"e'd thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. the teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond. the flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires. when he had moved away, tyrion could have sworn that the beast's empty eye sockets had watched him go.\\n\\n\\nthere were nineteen skulls. the oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere century and a half. the \", \"most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiff's skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on dragonstone. they were the last of the targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long.\\n\\n\\nfrom there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that aegon targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the seven kingdoms of old. the singers had given them th\", \"e names of gods: balerion, meraxes, vhaghar. tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed. you could have ridden a horse down vhaghar's gullet, although you would not have ridden it out again. meraxes was even bigger. and the greatest of them, balerion, the black dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the port of ibben.\\n\\n\\ntyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at balerion's huge, empt\", 'y-eyed skull until his torch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire.\\n\\n\\nhis own remote ancestor, king loren of the rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with king mern of the reach to oppose the targaryen conquest. that was close on three hundred years ago, when the seven kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. between', ' them, the two kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as many freeriders and men-at-arms. aegon dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties uncertain .\\n\\n\\nthe hosts met on the broad plains of the reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest. when the two kings charged, the targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run. ', 'for a few moments, the chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an end . . . but only for those few moments, before aegon targaryen and his sisters joined the battle.\\n\\n\\nit was the only time that vhaghar, meraxes, and balerion were all unleashed at once. the singers called it the field of fire.\\n\\n\\nnear four thousand men had burned that day, among them king mern of the reach. king loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the targaryens, and beget a son, for which ty', 'rion was duly grateful.\\n\\n\\n\"why do you read so much?\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. jon snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him curiously. he closed the book on a finger and said, \"look at me and tell me what you see.\"\\n\\n\\nthe boy looked at him suspiciously. \"is this some kind of trick? i see you. tyrion lannister.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion sighed. \"you are remarkably polite for a bastard, snow. what you see is a dwarf. you are what, twelve?\"\\n\\n\\n\"fourteen,\" the boy said.\\n\\n\\n\"fourteen, and yo', \"u're taller than i will ever be. my legs are short and twisted, and i walk with difficulty. i require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. a saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. it was either that or ride a pony. my arms are strong enough, but again, too short. i will never make a swordsman. had i been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver's grotesquerie. alas, i was born a lannister of casterly rock, and the grotesqueries\", \" are all the poorer. things are expected of me. my father was the hand of the king for twenty years. my brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. i must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? yet how? well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although i prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind. i have a\", ' realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. my mind is my weapon. my brother has his sword, king robert has his warhammer, and i have my mind . . . and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.\" tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. \"that\\'s why i read so much, jon snow.\"\\n\\n\\nthe boy absorbed that all in silence. he had the stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face that gave nothing away. whoever his mother had been, she had left lit', 'tle of herself in her son. \"what are you reading about?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\"dragons,\" tyrion told him.\\n\\n\\n\"what good is that? there are no more dragons,\" the boy said with the easy certainty of youth.\\n\\n\\n\"so they say,\" tyrion replied. \"sad, isn\\'t it? when i was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of my own.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you did?\" the boy said suspiciously. perhaps he thought tyrion was making fun of him.\\n\\n\\n\"oh, yes. even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he\\'s seated on ', 'a dragon\\'s back.\" tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. \"i used to start fires in the bowels of casterly rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. sometimes i\\'d imagine my father burning. at other times, my sister.\" jon snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. tyrion guffawed. \"don\\'t look at me that way, bastard. i know your secret. you\\'ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" jon snow said, horrified. \"i wouldn\\'t .', ' . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"no? never?\" tyrion raised an eyebrow. \"well, no doubt the starks have been terribly good to you. i\\'m certain lady stark treats you as if you were one of her own. and your brother robb, he\\'s always been kind, and why not? he gets winterfell and you get the wall. and your father . . . he must have good reasons for packing you off to the night\\'s watch . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"stop it,\" jon snow said, his face dark with anger. \"the night\\'s watch is a noble calling!\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion laughed. \"you\\'re too smart t', \"o believe that. the night's watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm. i've seen you looking at yoren and his boys. those are your new brothers, jon snow, how do you like them? sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. the good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it's scarcely dangerous work. the bad part is you freeze your b\", 'alls off, but since you\\'re not allowed to breed anyway, i don\\'t suppose that matters.\"\\n\\n\\n\"stop it!\" the boy screamed. he took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears.\\n\\n\\nsuddenly, absurdly, tyrion felt guilty. he took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology.\\n\\n\\nhe never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. one moment he was walking toward snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky g', 'round, the book spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. as he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. he must have wrenched it in the fall. he ground his teeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. \"help me,\" he said to the boy, reaching up a hand.\\n\\n\\nand suddenly the wolf was between them. he did not growl. the damned thing never made a sound. he only lo', 'oked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt. \"don\\'t help me, then. i\\'ll sit right here until you leave.\"\\n\\n\\njon snow stroked ghost\\'s thick white fur, smiling now. \"ask me nicely.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. it was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. perhaps he even deserved this. \"i should be ', 'very grateful for your kind assistance, jon,\" he said mildly.\\n\\n\\n\"down, ghost,\" the boy said. the direwolf sat on his haunches. those red eyes never left tyrion. jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. then he picked up the book and handed it back.\\n\\n\\n\"why did he attack me?\" tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. he wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand.\\n\\n\\n\"maybe he thought you were a grumkin.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion gla', 'nced at him sharply. then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. \"oh, gods,\" he said, choking on his laughter and shaking his head, \"i suppose i do rather look like a grumkin. what does he do to snarks?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you don\\'t want to know.\" jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to tyrion.\\n\\n\\ntyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. the wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throa', 't and warmed his belly. he held out the skin to jon snow. \"want some?\"\\n\\n\\nthe boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. \"it\\'s true, isn\\'t it?\" he said when he was done. \"what you said about the night\\'s watch.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion nodded.\\n\\n\\njon snow set his mouth in a grim line. \"if that\\'s what it is, that\\'s what it is.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion grinned at him. \"that\\'s good, bastard. most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"most men,\" the boy said. \"but not you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" tyrion admitted, \"not me. i se', 'ldom even dream of dragons anymore. there are no dragons.\" he scooped up the fallen bearskin. \"come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners.\"\\n\\n\\nthe walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back. jon snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but tyrion shook him off. he would make his own way, as he had all his life. still, the camp was a welcome sight. the shelters had been thrown up aga', 'inst the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. the horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. the savory smell of stew filled tyrion\\'s nostrils. he dragged himself over to where his man morrec was tending the stewpot. wordlessly, morrec handed him the ladle. tyrion tasted and handed it back. \"more pepper,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nbenjen stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. \"there you are. jon, damn it, don\\'t', ' go off like that by yourself. i thought the others had gotten you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it was the grumkins,\" tyrion told him, laughing. jon snow smiled. stark shot a baffled look at yoren. the old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work.\\n\\n\\nthe squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire. tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even yoren grew mellow. one by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all ', 'but jon snow, who had drawn the night\\'s first watch.\\n\\n\\ntyrion was the last to retire, as always. as he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at jon snow. the boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames.\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. \\n\\n\\ncatelyn\\n\\n\\nned and the girls were eight days gone when maester luwin came to her one night in bran\\'s sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account. \"it is pas', 't time that we reviewed the figures, my lady,\" he said. \"you\\'ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn looked at bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. it had grown very long, she realized. she would have to cut it soon. \"i have no need to look at figures, maester luwin,\" she told him, never taking her eyes from bran. \"i know what the visit cost us. take the books away.\"\\n\\n\\n\"my lady, the king\\'s party had healthy appetites. we must replenish our stores ', 'before - \"\\n\\n\\nshe cut him off. \"i said, take the books away. the steward will attend to our needs.\"\\n\\n\\n\"we have no steward,\" maester luwin reminded her. like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let go. \"poole went south to establish lord eddard\\'s household at king\\'s landing.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn nodded absently. \"oh, yes. i remember.\" bran looked so pale. she wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun.\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin set the lamp in a niche by the do', 'or and fiddled with its wick. \"there are several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill jory\\'s place, a new master of horse - \"\\n\\n\\nher eyes snapped around and found him. \"a master of horse?\" her voice was a whip.\\n\\n\\nthe maester was shaken. \"yes, my lady. hullen rode south with lord eddard, so - \"\\n\\n\\n\"my son lies here broken and dying, luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? do you think i care what happ', 'ens in the stables? do you think it matters to me one whit? i would gladly butcher every horse in winterfell with my own hands if it would open bran\\'s eyes, do you understand that? do you?\"\\n\\n\\nhe bowed his head. \"yes, my lady, but the appointments - \"\\n\\n\"i\\'ll make the appointments,\" robb said.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. she had been shouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. what was happening to her? she was so tired, and her he', 'ad hurt all the time.\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin looked from catelyn to her son. \"i have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices,\" he said, offering robb a paper plucked from his sleeve.\\n\\n\\nher son glanced at the names. he had come from outside, catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown. \"good men,\" he said. \"we\\'ll talk about them tomorrow.\" he handed back the list of names.\\n\\n\\n\"very good, my lord.\" the paper vanished into his sleeve.\\n\\n\\n\"l', 'eave us now,\" robb said. maester luwin bowed and departed. robb closed the door behind him and turned to her. he was wearing a sword, she saw. \"mother, what are you doing?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn had always thought robb looked like her; like bran and rickon and sansa, he had the tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. yet now for the first time she saw something of eddard stark in his face, something as stern and hard as the north. \"what am i doing?\" she echoed, puzzled. \"how can you ask that? what d', 'o you imagine i\\'m doing? i am taking care of your brother. i am taking care of bran.\"\\n\\n\\n\"is that what you call it? you haven\\'t left this room since bran was hurt. you didn\\'t even come to the gate when father and the girls went south.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window.\" she had begged ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldn\\'t he see that? it was no use. he had no choice, he had told her, and then he lef', 't, choosing. \"i can\\'t leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last. i have to be with him, if . . . if . . . \" she took her son\\'s limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own. he was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin.\\n\\n\\nrobb\\'s voice softened. \"he\\'s not going to die, mother. maester luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and what if maester luwin is wrong? what if bran needs m', 'e and i\\'m not here?\"\\n\\n\\n\"rickon needs you,\" robb said sharply. \"he\\'s only three, he doesn\\'t understand what\\'s happening. he thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. i don\\'t know what to do with him.\" he paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he\\'d done when he was little. \"mother, i need you too. i\\'m trying but i can\\'t . . . i can\\'t do it all by myself.\" his voice broke with sudden emotion, and catelyn remembered that he was only fo', 'urteen. she wanted to get up and go to him, but bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.\\n\\n\\noutside the tower, a wolf began to howl. catelyn trembled, just for a second.\\n\\n\\n\"bran\\'s.\" robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. the howling grew louder. it was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair.\\n\\n\\n\"don\\'t,\" she told him. \"bran needs to stay warm.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he needs to hear them sing,\" robb said. somewhere out in winterfell, a second wolf bega', 'n to howl in chorus with the first. then a third, closer. \"shaggydog and grey wind,\" robb said as their voices rose and fell together. \"you can tell them apart if you listen close.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn was shaking. it was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of', ' knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. \"make them stop!\" she cried. \"i can\\'t stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!\"\\n\\n\\nshe didn\\'t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and robb was lifting her, holding her in strong arms. \"don\\'t be afraid, mother. they would never hurt him.\" he helped her to her narrow bed in the corn', 'er of the sickroom. \"close your eyes,\" he said gently. \"rest. maester luwin tells me you\\'ve hardly slept since bran\\'s fall.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i can\\'t,\" she wept. \"gods forgive me, robb, i can\\'t, what if he dies while i\\'m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies . . . \" the wolves were still howling. she screamed and held her ears again. \"oh, gods, close the window!\"\\n\\n\\n\"if you swear to me you\\'ll sleep.\" robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling ', 'of the direwolves. \"dogs,\" he said, listening. \"all the dogs are barking. they\\'ve never done that before . . . \" catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. when she looked up, his face was pale in the lamplight. \"fire,\" he whispered.\\n\\n\\nfire, she thought, and then, bran! \"help me,\" she said urgently, sitting up. \"help me with bran.\"\\n\\n\\nrobb did not seem to hear her. \"the library tower\\'s on fire,\" he said.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. she sagged w', 'ith relief. bran was safe. the library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. \"thank the gods,\" she whispered.\\n\\n\\nrobb looked at her as if she\\'d gone mad. \"mother, stay here. i\\'ll come back as soon as the fire\\'s out.\" he ran then. she heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.\\n\\n\\noutside, there were shouts of \"fire!\" in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of ', 'frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. the howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony. the direwolves had fallen silent.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window. across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. she watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the starks had gathered over the centuries. then she closed the shutters.\\n\\n\\nwhen she t', 'urned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.\\n\\n\\n\"you weren\\'t s\\'posed to be here,\" he muttered sourly. \"no one was s\\'posed to be here.\"\\n\\n\\nhe was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. he was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn looked at the knife, then at bran. \"no,\" she said. the word stuck in he', 'r throat, the merest whisper.\\n\\n\\nhe must have heard her. \"it\\'s a mercy,\" he said. \"he\\'s dead already.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. \"no, you can\\'t.\" she spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. one hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. the stench of him was overwhelming.\\n\\n\\nshe reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all', ' her strength, pulling it away from her throat. she heard him cursing into her ear. her fingers were slippery with blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. the hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. she bit down hard into his palm. the man grunted in pain. she ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let go. the taste of his blood filled her mou', 'th. she sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, breathing hard, shaking. the dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. \"you weren\\'t s\\'posed to be here,\" he repeated stupidly.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. there was a low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he sta', 'rted to turn just as the wolf made its leap. they went down together, half sprawled over catelyn where she\\'d fallen. the wolf had him under the jaw. the man\\'s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head, taking out half his throat.\\n\\n\\nhis blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face.\\n\\n\\nthe wolf was looking at her. its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room . it was bran\\'s wolf, she realized. of course it was. \"thank you,\" catelyn ', \"whispered, her voice faint and tiny. she lifted her hand, trembling. the wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue. when it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on bran's bed and lay down beside him. catelyn began to laugh hysterically.\\n\\n\\nthat was the way they found them, when robb and maester luwin and ser rodrik burst in with half the guards in winterfell. when the laughter finally died in her throat, t\", \"hey wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the great keep, to her own chambers. old nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth.\\n\\n\\nafterward maester luwin arrived to dress her wounds. the cuts in her fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he'd pulled out a handful of hair. the maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep.\\n\\n\\nfinally s\", 'he closed her eyes.\\n\\n\\nwhen she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. catelyn nodded and sat up in bed. it all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since bran\\'s fall, a terrible dream of blood and grief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. she felt weak and light-headed, yet strangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her.\\n\\n\\n\"bring me some bread and honey,\" she told her servants, \"and take word to maester luwin that my ', 'bandages want changing.\" they looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. she had let them all down, her children, her husband, her house. it would not happen again. she would show these northerners how strong a tully of riverrun could be.\\n\\n\\nrobb arrived before her food. rodrik cassel came with him, and her husband\\'s ward theon greyjoy, and lastly hallis mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard. he was ', 'the new captain of the guard, robb said. her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at his waist.\\n\\n\\n\"who was he?\" catelyn asked them.\\n\\n\\n\"no one knows his name,\" hallis mollen told her. \"he was no man of winterfell, m\\'lady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.\"\\n\\n\\n\"one of the king\\'s men, then,\" she said, \"or one of the lannisters\\'. he could have waited behind when the others left.\"\\n\\n\\n\"maybe,\" hal said. \"with all these strang', 'ers filling up winterfell of late, there\\'s no way of saying who he belonged to.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'d been hiding in your stables,\" greyjoy said. \"you could smell it on him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and how could he go unnoticed?\" she said sharply.\\n\\n\\nhallis mollen looked abashed. \"between the horses lord eddard took south and them we sent north to the night\\'s watch, the stalls were half-empty. it were no great trick to hide from the stableboys. could be hodor saw him, the talk is that boy\\'s been acting queer, but simple as he is', ' . . . \" hal shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\"we found where he\\'d been sleeping,\" robb put in. \"he had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s good to know my son\\'s life was not sold cheaply,\" catelyn said bitterly.\\n\\n\\nhallis mollen looked at her, confused. \"begging your grace, m\\'lady, you saying he was out to kill your boy?\"\\n\\n\\ngreyjoy was doubtful. \"that\\'s madness.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he came for bran,\" catelyn said. \"he kept muttering how i wasn\\'t supposed to be there. he set the library fire', ' thinking i would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. if i hadn\\'t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.\"\\n\\n\\n\"why would anyone want to kill bran?\" robb said. \"gods, he\\'s only a little boy, helpless, sleeping . . . \"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. \"if you are to rule in the north, you must think these things through, robb. answer your own question. why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?\"\\n\\n\\nbefore he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of ', 'food fresh from the kitchen. there was much more than she\\'d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and blackberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea. and with it came maester luwin.\\n\\n\\n\"how is my son, maester?\" catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite.\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin lowered his eyes. \"unchanged, my lady.\"\\n\\n\\nit was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in ', 'her, cutting deep. she sent the servants away and looked back to robb. \"do you have the answer yet?\"\\n\\n\\n\"someone is afraid bran might wake up,\" robb said, \"afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of something he knows.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn was proud of him. \"very good.\" she turned to the new captain of the guard. \"we must keep bran safe. if there was one killer, there could be others.\"\\n\\n\\n\"how many guards do you want, rn\\'lady?\" hal asked.\\n\\n\\n\"so long as lord eddard is away, my son is the master of winterfe', 'll,\" she told him.\\n\\n\\nrobb stood a little taller. \"put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs. no one sees bran without my warrant or my mother\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\"as you say, m\\'lord.\"\\n\\n\\n\"do it now,\" catelyn suggested.\\n\\n\\n\"and let his wolf stay in the room with him,\" robb added.\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" catelyn said. and then again: \"yes.\"\\n\\n\\nhallis mollen bowed and left the room.\\n\\n\\n\"lady stark,\" ser rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, \"did you chance to notice the da', 'gger the killer used?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but i can vouch for its edge,\" catelyn replied with a dry smile. \"why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\\n\"we found the knife still in the villain\\'s grasp. it seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so i looked at it long and hard. the blade is valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. a weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him. someone gave it to him.\"\\n\\ncatelyn nodded, thoughtful. \"', 'robb, close the door.\"\\n\\n\\nhe looked at her strangely, but did as she told him.\\n\\n\\n\"what i am about to tell you must not leave this room,\" she told them. \"i want your oaths on that. if even part of what i suspect is true, ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.\"\\n\\n\\n\"lord eddard is a second father to me,\" said theon greyjoy. \"i do so swear.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you have my oath,\" maester luwin said.\\n\\n\\n\"and mine, my lady,\" echoed ser rodrik.\\n\\n\\nshe looked at', ' her son. \"and you, robb?\"\\n\\n\\nhe nodded his consent.\\n\\n\\n\"my sister lysa believes the lannisters murdered her husband, lord arryn, the hand of the king,\" catelyn told them. \"it comes to me that jaime lannister did not join the hunt the day bran fell. he remained here in the castle.\" the room was deathly quiet. \"i do not think bran fell from that tower,\" she said into the stillness. \"i think he was thrown.\"\\n\\n\\nthe shock was plain on their faces. \"my lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,\" said rodrik ', 'cassel. \"even the kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh, would he?\" theon greyjoy asked. \"i wonder.\"\\n\\n\\n\"there is no limit to lannister pride or lannister ambition,\" catelyn said.\\n\\n\\n\"the boy had always been surehanded in the past,\" maester luwin said thoughtfully. \"he knew every stone in winterfell.\"\\n\\n\\n\"gods,\" robb swore, his young face dark with anger. \"if this is true, he will pay for it.\" he drew his sword and waved it in the air. \"i\\'ll kill him myself!\"\\n\\n\\nser rodr', 'ik bristled at him. \"put that away! the lannisters are a hundred leagues away. never draw your sword unless you mean to use it. how many times must i tell you, foolish boy?\"\\n\\n\\nabashed, robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. catelyn said to ser rodrik, \"i see my son is wearing steel now.\"\\n\\n\\nthe old master-at-arms said, \"i thought it was time.\"\\n\\n\\nrobb was looking at her anxiously. \"past time,\" she said. \"winterfell may have need of all its swords soon, and they had best not be made of wo', 'od.\"\\n\\n\\ntheon greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, \"my lady, if it comes to that, my house owes yours a great debt.\"\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. \"all we have is conjecture. this is the queen\\'s beloved brother we mean to accuse. she will not take it kindly. we must have proof, or forever keep silent.\"\\n\\n\\n\"your proof is in the dagger,\" ser rodrik said. \"a fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.\"\\n\\n\\nthere was only one place t', 'o find the truth of it, catelyn realized. \"someone must go to king\\'s landing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'ll go,\" robb said.\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" she told him. \"your place is here. there must always be a stark in winterfell.\" she looked at ser rodrik with his great white whiskers, at maester luwin in his grey robes, at young greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous. who to send? who would be believed? then she knew. catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone. she climbed out of ', 'bed. \"i must go myself.\"\\n\\n\\n\"my lady,\" said maester luwin, \"is that wise? surely the lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what about bran?\" robb asked. the poor boy looked utterly confused now. \"you can\\'t mean to leave him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i have done everything i can for bran,\" she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. \"his life is in the hands of the gods and maester luwin. as you reminded me yourself, robb, i have other children to think of now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you will need a strong escort, my l', 'ady,\" theon said.\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'ll send hal with a squad of guardsmen,\" robb said.\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" catelyn said. \"a large party attracts unwelcome attention. i would not have the lannisters know i am coming.\"\\n\\n\\nser rodrik protested. \"my lady, let me accompany you at least. the kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i will not be taking the kingsroad,\" catelyn replied. she thought for a moment, then nodded her consent. \"two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burden', 'ed by wagons and wheelhouses. i will welcome your company, ser rodrik. we will follow the white knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at whiteharbor. strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to king\\'s landing well ahead of ned and the lannisters.\" and then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see.\\n\\nsansa\\n\\n\\neddard stark had left before dawn, septa mordane informed sansa as they broke their fast. \"the king sent for him. another hunt, i do believe. there are still wild aurochs in these la', 'nds, i am told.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'ve never seen an aurochs,\" sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to lady under the table. the direwolf took it from her hand, as delicate as a queen.\\n\\n\\nsepta mordane sniffed in disapproval. \"a noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,\" she said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread.\\n\\n\\n\"she\\'s not a dog, she\\'s a direwolf,\" sansa pointed out as lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. \"anyway, father said we could keep them wit', 'h us if we want.\"\\n\\n\\nthe septa was not appeased. \"you\\'re a good girl, sansa, but i do vow, when it comes to that creature you\\'re as willful as your sister arya.\" she scowled. \"and where is arya this morning?\"\\n\\n\\n\"she wasn\\'t hungry,\" sansa said, knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook\\'s boy.\\n\\n\\n\"do remind her to dress nicely today. the grey velvet, perhaps. we are all invited to ride with the queen and princess myr', 'cella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa already looked her best. she had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her nicest blue silks. she had been looking forward to today for more than a week. it was a great honor to ride with the queen, and besides, prince joffrey might be there. her betrothed. just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. sansa did not really know joffrey yet', ', but she was already in love with him. he was all she ever dreamt her prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. she treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were. the only thing that scared her about today was arya. arya had a way of ruining everything. you never knew what she would do. \"i\\'ll tell her,\" sansa said uncertainly, \"but she\\'ll dress the way she always does.\" she hoped it wouldn\\'t be too embarrassing. \"may i be excused?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you may.\" septa', \" mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and sansa slid from the bench. lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn's common room.\\n\\n\\noutside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day's march. the inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had accommodations for less than a third of the king\", '\\'s party, which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her father\\'s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road.\\n\\n\\nshe found arya on the banks of the trident, trying to hold nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur. the direwolf was not enjoying the process. arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before.\\n\\n\\n\"you better put on something pretty,\" sansa told her. \"septa mordane said so. we\\'re traveling in the qu', 'een\\'s wheelhouse with princess myrcella today.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m not,\" arya said, trying to brush a tangle out of nymeria\\'s matted grey fur. \"mycah and i are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.\"\\n\\n\\n\"rubies,\" sansa said, lost. \"what rubies?\"\\n\\n\\narya gave her a look like she was so stupid. \"rhaegar\\'s rubies. this is where king robert killed him and won the crown.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. \"you can\\'t look for rubies, the princess is expecting us. the queen in', 'vited us both.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care,\" arya said. \"the wheelhouse doesn\\'t even have windows, you can\\'t see a thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what could you want to see?\" sansa said, annoyed. she had been thrilled by the invitation, and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she\\'d feared. \"it\\'s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it is not,\" arya said stubbornly. \"if you came with us sometimes, you\\'d see.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i hate riding,\" sansa said fervently. \"all it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.', '\"\\n\\n\\narya shrugged. \"hold still,\" she snapped at nymeria, \"i\\'m not hurting you.\" then to sansa she said, \"when we were crossing the neck, i counted thirty-six flowers i never saw before, and mycah showed me a lizard-lion.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa shuddered. they had been twelve days crossing the neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog, and she had hated every moment of it. the air had been damp and clammy, the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night, they had ', 'to stop right on the kingsroad. dense thickets of half-drowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus. huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were quicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes and teeth.\\n\\n\\nnone of which stopped arya, of course. ', 'one day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for father. sansa kept hoping he would tell arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. that just made her worse.\\n\\n\\nthen it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and arya got a rash on her arms. sansa would have thought th', \"at might have taught her a lesson, but arya laughed about it, and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend mycah told her it would stop the itching. she had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches, sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep. how she had gotten those only the seven gods knew.\\n\\n\\narya was still going on, brushing out nymeria's tangles and chattering about thi\", 'ngs she\\'d seen on the trek south. \"last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses. you should have seen them run when they caught a scent of nymeria.\" the wolf wriggled in her grasp and arya scolded her. \"stop that, i have to do the other side, you\\'re all muddy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you\\'re not supposed to leave the column,\" sansa reminded her. \"father said so.\"\\n\\n\\narya shrugged. \"i didn\\'t go far. anyway, nymeria was with me the whole time. i don\\'t always go off, eit', 'her. sometimes it\\'s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa knew all about the sorts of people arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and na*ed children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. arya would make friends with anybody. this mycah was the worst; a butcher\\'s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. just the sight of him was enough to make sansa feel sick, but arya seemed to p', 'refer his company to hers.\\n\\n\\nsansa was running out of patience now. \"you have to come with me,\" she told her sister firmly. \"you can\\'t refuse the queen. septa mordane will expect you.\"\\n\\n\\narya ignored her. she gave a hard yank with the brush. nymeria growled and spun away, affronted. \"come back here!\"\\n\\n\\n\"there\\'s going to be lemon cakes and tea,\" sansa went on, all adult and reasonable. lady brushed against her leg. sansa scratched her ears the way she liked, and lady sat beside her on her haunche', 's, watching arya chase nymeria. \"why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t like the queen,\" arya said casually. sansa sucked in her breath, shocked that even arya would say such a thing, but her sister prattled on, heedless. \"she won\\'t even let me bring nymeria.\" she thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf. nymeria watched her approach warily.\\n\\n\\n\"a royal wheelhouse is ', 'no place for a wolf,\" sansa said. \"and princess myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.\"\\n\\n\\n\"myrcella is a little baby.\" arya grabbed nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. frustrated, arya threw down the brush. \"bad wolf!\" she shouted.\\n\\n\\nsansa couldn\\'t help but smile a little. the kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master. she gave lady a quick little hug. lady licked her cheek. sansa giggled. a', 'rya heard and whirled around, glaring. \"i don\\'t care what you say, i\\'m going out riding.\" her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful.\\n\\n\\n\"gods be true, arya, sometimes you act like such a child,\" sansa said. \"i\\'ll go by myself then. it will be ever so much nicer that way. lady and i will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you.\"\\n\\n\\nshe turned to walk off, but arya shouted after her, \"they won\\'t let you bring lady either.\" she', \" was gone before sansa could think of a reply, chasing nymeria along the river.\\n\\n\\nalone and humiliated, sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she knew septa mordane would be waiting. lady padded quietly by her side. she was almost in tears. all she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty, the way they were in the songs. why couldn't arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like princess myrcella? she would have liked a sister like that.\\n\\n\\nsansa could never understand how two sisters, bo\", \"rn only two years apart, could be so different. it would have been easier if arya had been a bastard, like their half brother jon. she even looked like jon, with the long face and brown hair of the starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring. and jon's mother had been common, or so people whispered. once, when she was littler, sansa had even asked mother if perhaps there hadn't been some mistake. perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister. but mother had only laughe\", \"d and said no, arya was her daughter and sansa's trueborn sister, blood of their blood. sansa could not think why mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had to be true.\\n\\nas she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. a crowd had gathered around the queen's wheelhouse. sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees. the doors had been thrown open, she saw, and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. she heard her sayin\", 'g, \"the council does us great honor, my good lords.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what\\'s happening?\" she asked a squire she knew.\\n\\n\\n\"the council sent riders from king\\'s landing to escort us the rest of the way,\" he told her. \"an honor guard for the king.\"\\n\\n\\nanxious to see, sansa let lady clear a path through the crowd. people moved aside hastily for the direwolf. when she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling before the queen, in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink.\\n\\n\\none knight wore an intricate suit of', ' white enameled scales, brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow, with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. when he removed his helm, sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that. from his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the kingsguard.\\n\\n\\nhis companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green. he was the handsomest man sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, w', 'ith jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. cradled under one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold.\\n\\n\\nat first sansa did not notice the third stranger. he did not kneel with the others. he stood to one side, beside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. his face was pockmarked and beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. though he was not an old man, o', 'nly a few wisps of hair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman\\'s. his armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard use. above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a two-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side.\\n\\n\\n\"the king is gone hunting, but i know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,\" the queen was saying to the ', 'two knights who knelt before her, but sansa could not take her eyes off the third man. he seemed to feel the weight of her gaze. slowly he turned his head. lady growled. a terror as overwhelming as anything sansa stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. she stepped backward and bumped into someone.\\n\\n\\nstrong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment sansa thought it was her father, but when she turned, it was the burned face of sandor clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a', ' terrible mockery of a smile. \"you are shaking, girl,\" he said, his voice rasping. \"do i frighten you so much?\"\\n\\n\\nhe did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face, though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. still, sansa wrenched away from him, and the hound laughed, and lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf. they were all gathered around gaping, she could f', 'eel their eyes on her, and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter.\\n\\n\\n\"a wolf,\" a man said, and someone else said, \"seven hells, that\\'s a direwolf,\" and the first man said, \"what\\'s it doing in camp?\" and the hound\\'s rasping voice replied, \"the starks use them for wet nurses,\" and sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and lady, swords in their hands, and then she was frightened again, and ashamed . tears filled her eyes.\\n\\n\\nshe heard the q', 'ueen say, \"joffrey, go to her.\"\\n\\n\\nand her prince was there.\\n\\n\\n\"leave her alone,\" joffrey said. he stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown. he gave her his hand, drew her to her feet. \"what is it, sweet lady? why are you afraid? no one will hurt you. put away your swords, all of you. the wolf is her little pet, that\\'s all.\" he looked at sandor clegane. \"and you, dog, away with you, you\\'re scaring my betrothed.\"\\n\\n\\nthe hound, ever f', 'aithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press. sansa struggled to steady herself. she felt like such a fool. she was a stark of winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be a queen. \"it was not him, my sweet prince,\" she tried to explain. \"it was the other one.\"\\n\\n\\nthe two stranger knights exchanged a look. \"payne?\" chuckled the young man in the green armor.\\n\\n\\nthe older man in white spoke to sansa gently. \"ofttimes ser ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady. he has a fearsome aspect', '.\"\\n\\n\\n\"as well he should.\" the queen had descended from the wheelhouse. the spectators parted to make way for her. \"if the wicked do not fear the mng\\'s justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa finally found her words. \"then surely you have chosen the right one, your grace,\" she said, and a gale of laughter erupted all around her.\\n\\n\\n\"well spoken, child,\" said the old man in white. \"as befits the daughter of eddard stark. i am honored to know you, however irregular the manner of ', 'our meeting. i am ser barristan selmy, of the kingsguard.\" he bowed.\\n\\n\\nsansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that septa mordane had taught her over the years came back to her. \"the lord commander of the kingsguard,\" she said, \"and councillor to robert our king and to aerys targaryen before him. the honor is mine, good knight. even in the far north, the singers praise the deeds of barristan the bold.\"\\n\\n\\nthe green knight laughed again. \"barristan the old, you mean. don\\'t flatter him too swee', 'tly, child, he thinks overmuch of himself already.\" he smiled at her. \"now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then i must concede that you are truly our hand\\'s daughter.\"\\n\\n\\njoffrey stiffened beside her. \"have a care how you address my betrothed.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i can answer,\" sansa said quickly, to quell her prince\\'s anger. she smiled at the green knight. \"your helmet bears golden antlers, my lord. the stag is the sigil of the royal house. king robert has two brothers. by your extreme youth, y', 'ou can only be renly baratheon, lord of storm\\'s end and councillor to the king, and so i name you.\"\\n\\n\\nser barristan chuckled. \"by his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so i name him.\"\\n\\n\\nthere was general laughter, led by lord renly himself. the tension of a few moments ago was gone, and sansa was beginning to feel comfortable . . . until ser ilyn payne shouldered two men aside, and stood before her, unsmiling. he did not say a word. lady bared her teeth and began to growl,', ' a low rumble full of menace, but this time sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. \"i am sorry if i offended you, ser ilyn,\" she said.\\n\\n\\nshe waited for an answer, but none came. as the headsman looked at her, his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, leaving her soul na*ed before him. still silent, he turned and walked away.\\n\\n\\nsansa did not understand. she looked at her prince. \"did i say something wrong, your grace? why will he not sp', 'eak to me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"ser ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,\" lord renly commented with a sly smile.\\n\\n\\njoffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took sansa\\'s hands in his own. \"aerys targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,\" the queen said, \"and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned.\" then she smiled graciously and said, \"sansa, the good councillors and i must speak together until the king ret', 'urns with your father. i fear we shall have to postpone your day with myrcella. please give your sweet sister my apologies. joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it would be my pleasure, mother,\" joffrey said very formally. he took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse, and sansa\\'s spirits took flight. a whole day with her prince! she gazed at joffrey worshipfully. he was so gallant, she thought. the way he had rescued her from ser ilyn and the ', 'hound, why, it was almost like the songs, like the time serwyn of the mirror shield saved the princess daeryssa from the giants, or prince aemon the dragonknight championing queen naerys\\'s honor against evil ser morgil\\'s slanders.\\n\\n\\nthe touch of joffrey\\'s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. \"what would you like to do?\"\\n\\n\\nbe with you, sansa thought, but she said, \"whatever you\\'d like to do, my prince.\"\\n\\n\\njofftey reflected a moment. \"we could go riding.\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh, i love riding,\" sansa sai', 'd.\\n\\n\\njoffrey glanced back at lady, who was following at their heels. \"your wolf is liable to frighten the horses, and my dog seems to frighten you. let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what do you say?\"\\n\\n\\nsansa hesitated. \"if you like,\" she said uncertainly. \"i suppose i could tie lady up.\" she did not quite understand, though. \"i didn\\'t know you had a dog . . . \"\\n\\n\\njoffrey laughed. \"he\\'s my mother\\'s dog, in truth. she has set him to guard me, and so he does.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you mean the ho', 'und,\" she said. she wanted to hit herself for being so slow. her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid. \"is it safe to leave him behind?\"\\n\\n\\nprince joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask. \"have no fear, lady. i am almost a man grown, and i don\\'t fight with wood like your brothers. all i need is this.\" he drew his sword and showed it to her; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and double-edged, with a leather grip and a lion\\'', 's-head pommel in gold. sansa exclaimed over it admiringly, and joffrey looked pleased. \"i call it lion\\'s tooth,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nand so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they ranged east along the north bank of the trident with no company save lion\\'s tooth.\\n\\n\\nit was a glorious day, a magical day. the air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers, and the woods here had a gentle beauty that sansa had never seen in the north. prince joffrey\\'s mount was a blood bay courser, ', 'swift as the wind, and he rode it with reckless abandon, so fast that sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare. it was a day for adventures. they explored the caves by the riverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady. they dined on trout fresh from the river, and sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before. \"my father only lets us have one cup, and ', 'only at feasts,\" she confessed to her prince.\\n\\n\\n\"my betrothed can drink as much as she wants,\" joffrey said, refilling her cup.\\n\\n\\nthey went more slowly after they had eaten. joffrey sang for her as they rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. sansa was a little dizzy from the wine. \"shouldn\\'t we be starting back?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n\"soon,\" joffrey said. \"the battleground is right up ahead, where the river bends. that was where my father killed rhaegar targaryen, you know. he smashed in his chest, cr', 'unch, right through the armor.\" joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done. \"then my uncle jaime killed old aerys, and my father was king. what\\'s that sound?\"\\n\\n\\nsansa heard it too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, snack snack snack. \"i don\\'t know,\" she said. it made her nervous, though. \"joffrey, let\\'s go back.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i want to see what it is.\" joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds, and sansa had no choice but to follow. the noises gre', 'w louder and more distinct, the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well, and now and then a grunt.\\n\\n\\n\"someone\\'s there,\" sansa said anxiously. she found herself thinking of lady, wishing the direwolf was with her.\\n\\n\\n\"you\\'re safe with me.\" joffrey drew his lion\\'s tooth from its sheath. the sound of steel on leather made her tremble. \"this way,\" he said, riding through a stand of trees.\\n\\n\\nbeyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and', \" a girl playing at knights. their swords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of them, and they were rushing across the grass, swinging at each other lustily. the boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and he was pressing the attack. the girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy's blows, but not all. when she tried to lunge at him, he caught her stick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood\", ' down hard on her fingers. she cried out and lost her weapon.\\n\\n\\nprince joffrey laughed. the boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and dropped his stick in the grass. the girl glared at them, sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out, and sansa was horrified. \"arya?\" she called out incredulously.\\n\\n\\n\"go away,\" arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. \"what are you doing here? leave us alone.\"\\n\\n\\njoffrey glanced from arya to sansa and back again. \"your sister?\" she nodded, blushi', 'ng. joffrey examined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckled face and thick red hair. \"and who are you, boy?\" he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior.\\n\\n\\n\"mycah,\" the boy muttered. he recognized the prince and averted his eyes. \"m\\'lord.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s the butcher\\'s boy,\" sansa said.\\n\\n\\n\"he\\'s my friend,\" arya said sharply. \"you leave him alone.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a butcher\\'s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?\" joffrey swung down from his mount, sword', ' in hand. \"pick up your sword, butcher\\'s boy,\" he said, his eyes bright with amusement. \"let us see how good you are.\"\\n\\n\\nmycah stood there, frozen with fear.\\n\\n\\njoffrey walked toward him. \"go on, pick it up. or do you only fight little girls?\"\\n\\n\\n\"she ast me to, m\\'lord,\" mycah said. \"she ast me to.\"\\n\\n\\nsansa had only to glance at arya and see the flush on her sister\\'s face to know the boy was telling the truth, but joffrey was in no mood to listen. the wine had made him wild. \"are you going to pick', ' up your sword?\"\\n\\n\\nmycah shook his head. \"it\\'s only a stick, m\\'lord. it\\'s not no sword, it\\'s only a stick.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and you\\'re only a butcher\\'s boy, and no knight.\" joffrey lifted lion\\'s tooth and laid its point on mycah\\'s cheek below the eye, as the butcher\\'s boy stood trembling. \"that was my lady\\'s sister you were hitting, do you know that?\" a bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into mycah\\'s flesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy\\'s cheek.\\n\\n\"stop it!\" arya screamed. she g', 'rabbed up her fallen stick.\\n\\n\\nsansa was afraid. \"arya, you stay out of this.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i won\\'t hurt him . . . much,\" prince joffrey told arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher\\'s boy.\\n\\n\\narya went for him.\\n\\n\\nsansa slid off her mare, but she was too slow. arya swung with both hands. there was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the prince\\'s head, and then everything happened at once before sansa\\'s horrified eyes. joffrey staggered and whirled around, roaring curses. mycah ran for the ', 'trees as fast as his legs would take him. arya swung at the prince again, but this time joffrey caught the blow on lion\\'s tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. the back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire. sansa was shrieking, \"no, no, stop it, stop it, both of you, you\\'re spoiling it,\" but no one was listening. arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at joffrey\\'s head. she hit his horse instead, and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after mycah. \"stop it', ', don\\'t, stop it!\" sansa screamed. joffrey slashed at arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. arya darted back, frightened now, but joffrey followed, hounding her toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. sansa didn\\'t know what to do. she watched helplessly, almost blind from her tears.\\n\\n\\nthen a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around joffrey\\'s sword arm. the steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked ', 'him off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. \"get it off,\" he screamed. \"get it off!\"\\n\\n\\narya\\'s voice cracked like a whip. \"nymeria!\"\\n\\n\\nthe direwolf let go of joffrey and moved to arya\\'s side. the prince lay in the grass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. his shirt was soaked in blood. arya said, \"she didn\\'t hurt you . . . much.\" she picked up lion\\'s tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with bot', 'h hands.\\n\\n\\njofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. \"no,\" he said, \"don\\'t hurt me. i\\'ll tell my mother.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you leave him alone!\" sansa screamed at her sister.\\n\\n\\narya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. the blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. it hit the water and vanished with a splash. joffrey moaned. arya ran off to her horse, nymeria loping at her heels.\\n\\n\\nafter they had gone, sansa went to princ', 'e joffrey. his eyes were closed in pain, his breath ragged. sansa knelt beside him. \"joffrey,\" she sobbed. \"oh, look what they did, look what they did. my poor prince. don\\'t be afraid. i\\'ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.\" tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair.\\n\\n\\nhis eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt. \"then go,\" he spit at her. \"and don\\'t touch me.\"\\n\\neddard\\n\\n\\nthey\\'ve found her, my lo', 'rd.\"\\n\\n\\nned rose quickly. \"our men or lannister\\'s?\"\\n\\n\\n\"it was jory,\" his steward vayon poole replied. \"she\\'s not been harmed.\"\\n\\n\\n\"thank the gods,\" ned said. his men had been searching for arya for four days now, but the queen\\'s men had been out hunting as well. \"where is she? tell jory to bring her here at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i am sorry, my lord,\" poole told him. \"the guards on the gate were lannister men, and they informed the queen when jory brought her in. she\\'s being taken directly before the king . . ', '. \"\\n\\n\\n\"damn that woman!\" ned said, striding to the door. \"find sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. her voice may be needed.\" he descended the tower steps in a red rage. he had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since arya had disappeared. this morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with strength.\\n\\n\\nmen called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but ned ignored them in h', \"is haste. he would have run, but he was still the king's hand, and a hand must keep his dignity. he was aware of the eyes that followed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do.\\n\\n\\nthe castle was a modest holding a half day's ride south of the trident. the royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord, ser raymun darry, while the hunt for arya and the butcher's boy was conducted on both sides of the river. they were not welcome visitors. ser raymun lived under the\", \" king's peace, but his family had fought beneath rhaegar's dragon banners at the trident, and his three older brothers had died there, a truth neither robert nor ser raymun had forgotten. with king's men, darry men, lannister men, and stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions burned hot and heavy.\\n\\n\\nthe king had appropriated ser raymun's audience chamber, and that was where ned found them. the room was crowded when he burst in. too crowded, he thought; left alone, he a\", 'nd robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably.\\n\\n\\nrobert was slumped in darry\\'s high seat at the far end of the room, his face closed and sullen. cersei lannister and her son stood beside him. the queen had her hand on joffrey\\'s shoulder. thick silken bandages still covered the boy\\'s arm.\\n\\n\\narya stood in the center of the room, alone but for jory cassel, every eye upon her. \"arya,\" ned called loudly. he went to her, his boots ringing on the stone floor. when she saw him, she cried ', 'out and began to sob.\\n\\n\\nned went to one knee and took her in his arms. she was shaking. \"i\\'m sorry,\" she sobbed, \"i\\'m sorry, i\\'m sorry.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i know,\" he said. she felt so tiny in his arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. it was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble. \"are you hurt?\"\\n\\n\\n\"no.\" her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. \"hungry some. i ate some berries, but there was nothing else.\"\\n\\n\\n\"we\\'ll feed you soon enough,\" ned promised. he rose to face the k', 'ing. \"what is the meaning of this?\" his eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. but for his own men, they were few enough. ser raymun darry guarded his look well. lord renly wore a half smile that might mean anything, and old ser barristan was grave; the rest were lannister men, and hostile. their only good fortune was that both jaime lannister and sandor clegane were missing, leading searches north of the trident. \"why was i not told that my daughter had been found?\" ned demanded, hi', 's voice ringing. \"why was she not brought to me at once?\"\\n\\n\\nhe spoke to robert, but it was cersei lannister who answered. \"how dare you speak to your king in that manner!\"\\n\\n\\nat that, the king stirred. \"quiet, woman,\" he snapped. he straightened in his seat. \"i am sorry, ned. i never meant to frighten the girl. it seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and what business is that?\" ned put ice in his voice.\\n\\n\\nthe queen stepped forward. \"you know full well, stark. ', 'this girl of yours attacked my son. her and her butcher\\'s boy. that animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that\\'s not true,\" arya said loudly. \"she just bit him a little. he was hurting mycah.\"\\n\\n\\n\"joff told us what happened,\" the queen said. \"you and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that\\'s not how it was,\" arya said, close to tears again. ned put a hand on her shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\"yes it is!\" prince joffrey insisted. \"they all attacked me, and she threw lion', '\\'s tooth in the river!\" ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at arya as he spoke.\\n\\n\\n\"liar!\" arya yelled.\\n\\n\\n\"shut up!\" the prince yelled back.\\n\\n\\n\"enough!\" the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. silence fell. he glowered at arya through his thick beard. \"now, child, you will tell me what happened. tell it all, and tell it true. it is a great crime to lie to a king.\" then he looked over at his son. \"when she is done, you will have your turn. until then, hol', 'd your tongue.\"\\n\\n\\nas arya began her story, ned heard the door open behind him. he glanced back and saw vayon poole enter with sansa. they stood quietly at the back of the hall as arya spoke. when she got to the part where she threw joffrey\\'s sword into the middle of the trident, renly baratheon began to laugh. the king bristled. \"ser barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.\"\\n\\n\\nlord renly stifled his laughter. \"my brother is too kind. i can find the door myself.\" he bowed to j', 'offrey. \"perchance later you\\'ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.\" as the door swung shut behind him, ned heard him say, \"lion\\'s tooth,\" and guffaw once more.\\n\\n\\nprince joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. when his son was done talking, the king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here. \"what in all the seven hells am i supposed t', 'o make of this? he says one thing, she says another.\"\\n\\n\\n\"they were not the only ones present,\" ned said. \"sansa, come here.\" ned had heard her version of the story the night arya had vanished. he knew the truth. \"tell us what happened.\"\\n\\n\\nhis eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. she was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around her neck . her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone. she blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. \"i don\\'t know,\" she ', 'said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. \"i don\\'t remember. everything happened so fast, i didn\\'t see . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"you rotten!\" arya shrieked. she flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking sansa down to the ground, pummeling her. \"liar, liar, liar, liar.\"\\n\\n\\n\"arya, stop it!\" ned shouted. jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. sansa was pale and shaking as ned lifted her back to her feet. \"are you hurt?\" he asked, but she was staring at arya, and she did not seem to hear.\\n\\n\\n\"the girl', ' is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,\" cersei lannister said. \"robert, i want her punished.\"\\n\\n\\n\"seven hells,\" robert swore. \"cersei, look at her. she\\'s a child. what would you have me do, whip her through the streets? damn it, children fight. it\\'s over. no lasting harm was done.\"\\n\\n\\nthe queen was furious. \"joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert baratheon looked at his eldest son. \"so he will. perhaps they will teach him a lesson. ned, see that your daughter is discip', 'lined. i will do the same with my son.\"\\n\\n\\n\"gladly, your grace,\" ned said with vast relief.\\n\\n\\nrobert started to walk away, but the queen was not done. \"and what of the direwolf?\" she called after him. \"what of the beast that savaged your son?\"\\n\\n\\nthe king stopped, turned back, frowned. \"i\\'d forgotten about the damned wolf.\"\\n\\n\\nned could see arya tense in jory\\'s arms. jory spoke up quickly. \"we found no trace of the direwolf, your grace.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert did not look unhappy. \"no? so be it.\"\\n\\n\\nthe queen ra', 'ised her voice. \"a hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin!\"\\n\\n\\n\"a costly pelt,\" robert grumbled. \"i want no part of this, woman. you can damn well buy your furs with lannister gold.\"\\n\\n\\nthe queen regarded him coolly. \"i had not thought you so niggardly. the king i\\'d thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert\\'s face darkened with anger. \"that would be a fine trick, without a wolf.\"\\n\\n\\n\"we have a wolf,\" cersei lannister said. her voic', 'e was very quiet, but her green eyes shone with triumph.\\n\\n\\nit took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the king shrugged irritably. \"as you will. have ser ilyn see to it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"robert, you cannot mean this,\" ned protested.\\n\\n\\nthe king was in no mood for more argument. \"enough, ned, i will hear no more. a direwolf is a savage beast. sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son. get her a dog, she\\'ll be happier for it.\"\\n\\n\\nthat was wh', 'en sansa finally seemed to comprehend. her eyes were frightened as they went to her father. \"he doesn\\'t mean lady, does he?\" she saw the truth on his face. \"no,\" she said. \"no, not lady, lady didn\\'t bite anybody, she\\'s good . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"lady wasn\\'t there,\" arya shouted angrily. \"you leave her alone!\"\\n\\n\\n\"stop them,\" sansa pleaded, \"don\\'t let them do it, please, please, it wasn\\'t lady, it was nymeria, arya did it, you can\\'t, it wasn\\'t lady, don\\'t let them hurt lady, i\\'ll make her be good, i promise,', ' i promise . . . \" she started to cry.\\n\\n\\nall ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept. he looked across the room at robert. his old friend, closer than any brother. \"please, robert. for the love you bear me. for the love you bore my sister. please.\"\\n\\n\\nthe king looked at them for a long moment, then turned his eyes on his wife. \"damn you, cersei,\" he said with loathing.\\n\\n\\nned stood, gently disengaging himself from sansa\\'s grasp. all the weariness of the past four days had', ' returned to him. \"do it yourself then, robert,\" he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel. \"at least have the courage to do it yourself.\"\\n\\n\\nrobert looked at ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, his footsteps heavy as lead. silence filled the hall.\\n\\n\\n\"where is the direwolf?\" cersei lannister asked when her husband was gone. beside her, prince joffrey was smiling.\\n\\n\\n\"the beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, your grace,\" ser barristan selmy answered reluctantly.\\n\\n\\n\"send for ily', 'n payne.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" ned said. \"jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me ice.\" the words tasted of bile in his throat, but he forced them out. \"if it must be done, i will do it.\"\\n\\n\\ncersei lannister regarded him suspiciously. \"you, stark? is this some trick? why would you do such a thing?\"\\n\\n\\nthey were all staring at him, but it was sansa\\'s look that cut. \"she is of the north. she deserves better than a butcher.\"\\n\\n\\nhe left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter\\'s wails echoing i', 'n his ears, and found the direwolf pup where they chained her. ned sat beside her for a while. \"lady,\" he said, tasting the name. he had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked, but looking at her now, he knew that sansa had chosen well. she was the smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and trusting. she looked at him with bright golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey fur.\\n\\nshortly, jory brought him ice.\\n\\n\\nwhen it was over, he said, \"choose four men an', 'd have them take the body north. bury her at winterfell.\"\\n\\n\\n\"all that way?\" jory said, astonished.\\n\\n\\n\"all that way,\" ned affirmed. \"the lannister woman shall never have this skin.\"\\n\\n\\nhe was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when sandor clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate, back from their hunt.\\n\\n\\nthere was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak. \"no sign of your daughter, hand,\" the hound rasped d', 'own, \"but the day was not wholly wasted. we got her little pet.\" he reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of ned.\\n\\n\\nbending, ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for arya, but it was not nymeria after all. it was the butcher\\'s boy, mycah, his body covered in dried blood. he had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above.\\n\\n\\n\"you rode him down,\" ned said.\\n\\n\\nthe hound\\'s eyes seemed to glit', 'ter through the steel of that hideous dog\\'s-head helm. \"he ran.\" he looked at ned\\'s face and laughed. \"but not very fast.\" \\n\\n\\nbran\\n\\n\\nit seemed as though he had been falling for years.\\n\\n\\nfly, a voice whispered in the darkness, but bran did not know how to fly, so all he could do was fall.\\n\\n\\nmaester luwin made a little boy of clay, baked him till he was hard and brittle, dressed him in bran\\'s clothes, and flung him off a roof. bran remembered the way he shattered. \"but i never fall,\" he said, fall', \"ing.\\n\\n\\nthe ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him, but he could feel how fast he was falling, and he knew what was waiting for him down there. even in dreams, you could not fall forever. he would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground, he knew. you always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground.\\n\\n\\nand if you don't? the voice asked.\\n\\n\\nthe ground was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles away, but closer t\", 'han it had been. it was cold here in the darkness. there was no sun, no stars, only the ground below coming up to smash him, and the grey mists, and the whispering voice. he wanted to cry.\\n\\n\\nnot cry. fly.\\n\\n\\n\"i can\\'t fly,\" bran said. \"i can\\'t, i can\\'t . . . \"\\n\\n\\nhow do you know? have you ever tried?\\n\\n\\nthe voice was high and thin. bran looked around to see where it was coming from. a crow was spiraling down with him, just out of reach, following him as he fell. \"help me,\" he said.\\n\\n\\ni\\'m trying, the', ' crow replied. say, got any corn?\\n\\n\\nbran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him. when he pulled his hand out, golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air. they fell with him.\\n\\n\\nthe crow landed on his hand and began to eat.\\n\\n\\n\"are you really a crow?\" bran asked.\\n\\n\\nare you really falling? the crow asked back.\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s just a dream,\" bran said.\\n\\n\\nis it? asked the crow.\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'ll wake up when i hit the ground,\" bran told the bird.\\n\\n\\nyou\\'ll die when you hit the gro', 'und, the crow said. it went back to eating corn.\\n\\n\\nbran looked down. he could see mountains now, their peaks white with snow, and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods. he closed his eyes and began to cry.\\n\\n\\nthat won\\'t do any good, the crow said. i told you, the answer is flying, not crying. how hard can it be? i\\'m doing it. the crow took to the air and flapped around bran\\'s hand.\\n\\n\\n\"you have wings,\" bran pointed out.\\n\\n\\nmaybe you do too.\\n\\n\\nbran felt along his shoulders, groping for feathers.', '\\n\\n\\nthere are different kinds of wings, the crow said.\\n\\n\\nbran was staring at his arms, his legs. he was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. had he always been so thin? he tried to remember. a face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden. \"the things i do for love,\" it said.\\n\\n\\nbran screamed.\\n\\n\\nthe crow took to the air, cawing. not that, it shrieked at him. forget that, you do not need it now, put it aside, put it away. it landed on bran\\'s shoulder, and pecked at', ' him, and the shining golden face was gone.\\n\\n\\nbran was falling faster than ever. the grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below. \"what are you doing to me?\" he asked the crow, tearful.\\n\\n\\nteaching you how to fly.\\n\\n\\n\"i can\\'t fly!\"\\n\\n\\nyou\\'re flying tight now.\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m falling!\"\\n\\n\\nevery flight begins with a fall, the crow said. look down.\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m afraid . . . \"\\n\\n\\nlook down!\\n\\n\\nbran looked down, and felt his insides turn to water. the ground was rushing up at him now. the whole worl', 'd was spread out below him, a tapestry of white and brown and green. he could see everything so clearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid. he could see the whole realm, and everyone in it.\\n\\n\\nhe saw winterfell as the eagles see it, the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above, the castle walls just lines in the dirt. he saw maester luwin on his balcony, studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book. he saw his brother robb, taller and strong', \"er than he remembered him, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand. he saw hodor, the simple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to mikken's forge, hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay. at the heart of the godswood, the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool, its leaves rustling in a chill wind. when it felt bran watching, it lifted its eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly.\\n\\n\\nh\", 'e looked east, and saw a galley racing across the waters of the bite. he saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and ser rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving . a storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning, but somehow they could not see it.\\n\\n\\nhe looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the trident. he saw his father pleading with the king, his face', ' etched with grief. he saw sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. there were shadows all around them. one shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.\\n\\n\\nhe lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow s', 'ea, to the free cities and the green dothraki sea and beyond, to vaes dothrak under its mountain, to the fabled lands of the jadesea, to asshai by the shadow, where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise.\\n\\n\\nfinally he looked north. he saw the wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. and he looked past the wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the', ' great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. north and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. he looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.\\n\\n\\nnow you know, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. now you know why you must live.\\n\\n\\n\"why?\" bran said, not understanding, falling, falling.\\n\\n\\nbecause winter is coming.\\n\\n\\nbr', 'an looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. it had three eyes, and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge. bran looked down. there was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him. they flew up at him like spears. he saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points. he was desperately afraid.\\n\\n\\n\"can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\" he heard his own voice sayi', 'ng, small and far away.\\n\\n\\nand his father\\'s voice replied to him. \"that is the only time a man can be brave.\"\\n\\n\\nnow, bran, the crow urged. choose. fly or die.\\n\\n\\ndeath reached for him, screaming.\\n\\n\\nbran spread his arms and flew.\\n\\n\\nwings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward. the terrible needles of ice receded below him. the sky opened up above. bran soared. it was better than climbing. it was better than anything. the world grew small beneath him.\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m flying!\" he cried out in ', 'delight.\\n\\n\\ni\\'ve noticed, said the three-eyed crow. it took to the air, flapping its wings in his face, slowing him, blinding him. he faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks. its beak stabbed at him fiercely, and bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead, between his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\"what are you doing?\" he shrieked.\\n\\n\\nthe crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil,', ' and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from winterfell, yes, that was it, he remembered her now, and then he realized that he was in winterfell, in a bed high in some chilly tower room, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps, shouting, \"he\\'s awake, he\\'s awake, he\\'s awake.\"\\n\\n\\nbran touched his forehead, between his eyes. the place where the crow had pecked him wa', 's still burning, but there was nothing there, no blood, no wound. he felt weak and dizzy. he tried to get out of bed, but nothing happened.\\n\\n\\nand then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly on his legs. he felt nothing. a pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like the sun. the window was open and it was cold in the room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath. his pup, bran realized . . . or was it? he was so big now. he reached out', ' to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf.\\n\\n\\nwhen his brother robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf was licking bran\\'s face. bran looked up calmly. \"his name is summer,\" he said.\\n\\ncatelyn\\n\\n\\nwe will make king\\'s landing within the hour.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile. \"your oarmen have done well by us, captain. each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.\"\\n\\n\\ncaptain moreo turnitis favored he', 'r with a half bow. \"you are far too generous, lady stark. the honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.\"\\n\\n\\n\"but they\\'ll take the silver anyway.\"\\n\\n\\nmoreo smiled. \"as you say.\" he spoke the common tongue fluently, with only the slightest hint of a tyroshi accent. he\\'d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, he\\'d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, and finally captain of his own trading galleys. the storm dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a two-masted', \" galley of sixty oars.\\n\\n\\nshe had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in whiteharbor when catelyn and ser rodrik cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. the tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, and ser rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the three sisters, but catelyn had insisted on the galley. it was good that she had. the winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without the galley's oars they'd still be beating their way past the \", 'fingers, instead of skimming toward king\\'s landing and journey\\'s end.\\n\\n\\nso close, she thought. beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. the pain was her scourge, catelyn felt, lest she forget. she could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand, and the others would never again be dexterous. yet that was a small enough price to pay for bran\\'s life.\\n\\n\\nser rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. \"my good friend,\" said moreo through his forked gre', 'en beard. the tyroshi loved bright colors, even in their facial hair. \"it is so fine to see you looking better.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" ser rodrik agreed. \"i haven\\'t wanted to die for almost two days now.\" he bowed to catelyn. \"my lady.\"\\n\\n\\nhe was looking better. a shade thinner than he had been when they set out from whiteharbor, but almost himself again. the strong winds in the bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him, and he\\'d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unex', 'pectedly off dragonstone, yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of moreo\\'s men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks.\\n\\n\\n\"the captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,\" she said.\\n\\n\\nser rodrik managed a wry smile. \"so soon?\" he looked odd without his great white side whiskers; smaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. yet back on the bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewman\\'s razor, after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for ', 'the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds.\\n\\n\\n\"i will leave you to discuss your business,\" captain moreo said. he bowed and took his leave of them.\\n\\n\\nthe galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, her oars rising and falling in perfect time. ser rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore. \"i have not been the most valiant of protectors.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn touched his arm. \"we are here, ser rodrik, and safely. that is all that truly matters.\" her hand', ' groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. the dagger was still at her side. she found she had to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. \"now we must reach the king\\'s master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.\"\\n\\n\\n\"ser aron santagar is a vain man, but an honest one.\" ser rodrik\\'s hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. he looked nonplussed. \"he may know the blade, yes . . . but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are ', 'at risk. and there are those at court who will know you on sight.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn\\'s mouth grew tight. \"littlefinger,\" she murmured. his face swam up before her; a boy\\'s face, though he was a boy no longer. his father had died several years before, so he was lord baelish now, yet still they called him littlefinger. her brother edmure had given him that name, long ago at riverrun. his family\\'s modest holdings were on the smallest of the fingers, and petyr had been slight and short for his age.\\n\\n\\nser ro', 'drik cleared his throat. \"lord baelish once, ah . . . \" his thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn was past delicacy. \"he was my father\\'s ward. we grew up together in riverrun. i thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were . . . more than brotherly. when it was announced that i was to wed brandon stark, petyr challenged for the right to my hand. it was madness. brandon was twenty, petyr scarcely fifteen. i had to beg brandon to spare petyr\\'s life. h', 'e let him off with a scar. afterward my father sent him away. i have not seen him since.\" she lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away. \"he wrote to me at riverrun after brandon was killed, but i burned the letter unread. by then i knew that ned would marry me in his brother\\'s place.\"\\n\\nser rodrik\\'s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. \"littlefinger sits on the small council now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i knew he would rise high,\" catelyn said. \"he was always cl', 'ever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. i wonder what the years have done to him.\"\\n\\n\\nhigh overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. captain moreo came scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around them the storm dancer burst into frenetic activity as king\\'s landing slid into view atop its three high hills.\\n\\n\\nthree hundred years ago, catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the', \" north shore of the blackwater rush where that deep, swift river flowed into the sea. then aegon the conqueror had sailed from dragonstone. it was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth.\\n\\n\\nnow the city covered the shore as far as catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant's stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. she could hear\", \" the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees, wandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. visenya's hill was crowned by the great sept of baelor with its seven crystal towers. across the city on the hill of rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors closed now for a century. the street of the sisters ran between them, straight a\", \"s an arrow. the city walls rose in the distance, high and strong.\\n\\n\\na hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the blackwater rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from braavos and pentos and lys. catelyn spied the queen's ornate barge, tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the port of ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested i\", \"n their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water.\\n\\n\\nand above it all, frowning down from aegon's high hill, was the red keep; seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and dungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers' nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. aegon the conqueror had commanded it built. his son maegor the cruel had seen it completed. afterward he had taken the he\", 'ads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the dragonlords had built, he vowed.\\n\\n\\nyet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of house baratheon.\\n\\n\\na high-masted swan ship from the summer isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with wind. the storm dancer moved past', ' it, pulling steadily for shore.\\n\\n\\n\"my lady,\" ser rodrik said, \"i have thought on how best to proceed while i lay abed. you must not enter the castle. i will go in your stead and bring ser aron to you in some safe place.\"\\n\\n\\nshe studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. moreo was shouting in the vulgar valyrian of the free cities. \"you would be as much at risk as i would.\"\\n\\n\\nser rodrik smiled. \"i think not. i looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized mys', 'elf. my mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. i believe i am safe enough, my lady.\"\\n\\n\\nmoreo bellowed a command. as one, sixty oars lifted from the river, then reversed and backed water. the galley slowed. another shout. the oars slid back inside the hull. as they thumped against the dock, tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. moreo came bustling up, all smiles. \"king\\'s landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer ', 'passage. will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?\"\\n\\n\\n\"we shall not be going to the castle. perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.\"\\n\\n\\nthe tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. \"just so. i know of several establishments that might suit your needs. yet first, if i may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon. and of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. six', 'ty stags, i believe it was.\"\\n\\n\\n\"for the oarmen,\" catelyn reminded him.\\n\\n\\n\"oh, of a certainty,\" said moreo. \"though perhaps i should hold it for them until we return to tyrosh. for the sake of their wives and children. if you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night\\'s pleasure.\"\\n\\n\\n\"there are worse things to spend money on,\" ser rodrik put in. \"winter is coming.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a man must make his own choices,\" catelyn said. \"they earned the silver. how they spend', ' it is no concern of mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\"as you say, my lady,\" moreo replied, bowing and smiling.\\n\\n\\njust to be sure, catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up visenya\\'s hill to the inn that moreo had suggested. it was a rambling old place on eel alley. the woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. her rooms were larg', 'e and airy, though, and moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the seven kingdoms. best of all, she had no interest in their names.\\n\\n\\n\"i think it best if you stay away from the common room,\" ser rodrik said, after they had settled in. \"even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.\" he wore ringmail, dagger, and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head . \"i will be back before nightfall, with ser aron,\" he promised. \"rest now, my', ' lady.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn was tired. the voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no longer as young as she had been. her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the blackwater beyond. she watched ser rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. the bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep.\\n\\n\\nshe woke to a pounding on her door.\\n\\n\\ncatelyn sat up sharply. ', 'outside the window, the rooftops of king\\'s landing were red in the light of the setting sun. she had slept longer than she intended. a fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called out, \"open, in the name of the king.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a moment,\" she called out. she wrapped herself in her cloak. the dagger was on the bedside table. she snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door.\\n\\n\\nthe men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the city watch. their leader sm', 'iled at the dagger in her hand and said, \"no need for that, m\\'lady. we\\'re to escort you to the castle.\"\\n\\n\\n\"by whose authority?\" she said.\\n\\n\\nhe showed her a ribbon. catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. the seal was a mockingbird, in grey wax. \"petyr,\" she said. so soon. something must have happened to ser rodrik. she looked at the head guardsman. \"do you know who i am?\"\\n\\n\\n\"no, m\\'lady,\" he said. \"m\\'lord littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not mistreated.\"\\n\\n\\nca', 'telyn nodded. \"you may wait outside while i dress.\"\\n\\n\\nshe bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. her fingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck. how could littlefinger have known she was here? ser rodrik would never have told him. old he might be, but he was stubborn, and loyal to a fault. were they too late, had the lannisters reached king\\'s landing before her? no, if that were true, ned would be here ', \"too, and surely he would have come to her. how . . . ?\\n\\n\\nthen she thought, moreo. the tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. she hoped he'd gotten a good price for the information.\\n\\n\\nthey had brought a horse for her. the lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks. when they reached the red keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, \", 'but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights. the guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower.\\n\\n\\nhe was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil lamp beside him as he wrote. when they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her. \"cat,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\\n\"why have i been brought here in this fashion?\"\\n\\n\\nhe rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. \"leave us.\" the men dep', 'arted. \"you were not mistreated, i trust,\" he said after they had gone. \"i gave firm instructions.\" he noticed her bandages. \"your hands . . . \"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn ignored the implied question. \"i am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,\" she said icily. \"as a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'ve angered you, my lady. that was never my intent.\" he looked contrite. the look brought back vivid memories for catelyn. he had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always', ' looked contrite; it was a gift he had. the years had not changed him much. petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a small man, an inch or two shorter than catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. he had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads of silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. they went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak. even as a child, he had always loved his sil', 'ver.\\n\\n\\n\"how did you know i was in the city?\" she asked him.\\n\\n\\n\"lord varys knows all,\" petyr said with a sly smile. \"he will be joining us shortly, but i wanted to see you alone first. it has been too long, cat. how many years?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn ignored his familiarity. there were more important questions. \"so it was the king\\'s spider who found me.\"\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger winced. \"you don\\'t want to call him that. he\\'s very sensitive. comes of being an eunuch, i imagine. nothing happens in this city without vary', 's knowing. oftimes he knows about it before it happens. he has informants everywhere. his little birds, he calls them. one of his little birds heard about your visit. thankfully, varys came to me first.\"\\n\\n\\n\"why you?\"\\n\\n\\nhe shrugged. \"why not me? i am master of coin, the king\\'s own councillor. selmy and lord renly rode north to meet robert, and lord stannis is gone to dragonstone, leaving only maester pycelle and me. i was the obvious choice. i was ever a friend to your sister lysa, varys knows th', 'at.\"\\n\\n\\n\"does varys know about . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"lord varys knows everything . . . except why you are here.\" he lifted an eyebrow. \"why are you here?\"\\n\\n\\n\"a wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her no?\"\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger laughed. \"oh, very good, my lady, but please don\\'t expect me to believe that. i know you too well. what were the tully words again?\"\\n\\n\\nher throat was dry. \"family, duty, honor,\" she recited stiffly. he did know her too well.\\n\\n\\n\"fa', 'mily, duty, honor,\" he echoed. \"all of which required you to remain in winterfell, where our hand left you. no, my lady, something has happened. this sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. i beg of you, let me help. old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.\" there was a soft knock on the door. \"enter,\" littlefinger called out.\\n\\n\\nthe man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. he wore a vest of woven gold thread over ', 'a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet. \"lady stark,\" he said, taking her hand in both of his, \"to see you again after so many years is such a joy.\" his flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. \"oh, your poor hands. have you burned yourself, sweet lady? the fingers are so delicate . . . our good maester pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall i send for a jar?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. \"i thank you, my lord, but my ow', 'n maester luwin has already seen to my hurts.\"\\n\\n\\nvarys bobbed his head. \"i was grievous sad to hear about your son. and him so young. the gods are cruel.\"\\n\\n\\n\"on that we agree, lord varys,\" she said. the title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers.\\n\\n\\nthe eunuch spread his soft hands. \"on more than that, i hope, sweet lady. i have great esteem for your husband, our new hand, and i know we do both love king', ' robert.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes,\" she was forced to say. \"for a certainty.\"\\n\\n\\n\"never has a king been so beloved as our robert,\" quipped littlefinger. he smiled slyly. \"at least in lord varys\\'s hearing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"good lady,\" varys said with great solicitude. \"there are men in the free cities with wondrous healing powers. say only the word, and i will send for one for your dear bran.\"\\n\\n\\n\"maester luwin is doing all that can be done for bran,\" she told him. she would not speak of bran, not here, not with these men. she ', 'trusted littlefinger only a little, and varys not at all. she would not let them see her grief. \"lord baelish tells me that i have you to thank for bringing me here.\"\\n\\n\\nvarys giggled like a little girl. \"oh, yes. i suppose i am guilty. i hope you forgive me, kind lady.\" he eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. \"i wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. he was a spider, she thought wildly, an enchanter ', 'or worse. he knew things no one could possibly know, unless . . . \"what have you done to ser rodrik?\" she demanded.\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger was lost. \"i feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance. what dagger are we talking about? who is ser rodrik?\"\\n\\n\\n\"ser rodrik cassel is master-at-arms at winterfell,\" varys informed him. \"i assure you, lady stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight. he did call here early this afternoon. he visited with ser aron santagar in th', 'e armory, and they talked of a certain dagger. about sunset, they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. they are still there, drinking in the common room, waiting for your return. ser rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.\"\\n\\n\"how could you know all that?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the whisperings of little birds,\" varys said, smiling. \"i know things, sweet lady. that is the nature of my service.\" he shrugged. \"you do have the dagger with you, yes?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn pulled it', ' out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him. \"here. perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.\"\\n\\n\\nvarys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge. blood welled, and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table.\\n\\n\\n\"careful,\" catelyn told him, \"it\\'s sharp.\"\\n\\n\\n\"nothing holds an edge like valyrian steel,\" littlefinger said as varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at catelyn with sull', 'en admonition. littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. he flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. \"such sweet balance. you want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit? you have no need of ser aron for that, my lady. you should have come to me.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and if i had,\" she said, \"what would you have told me?\"\\n\\n\\n\"i would have told you that there was only one knife like this at king\\'s landing.\" he grasped the blade between thumb and forefinge', 'r, drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. it struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. \"it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yours?\" it made no sense. petyr had not been at winterfell.\\n\\n\\n\"until the tourney on prince joffrey\\'s name day,\" he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood. \"i backed ser jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.\" petyr\\'s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again. \"when loras tyrell unhor', 'sed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. ser jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and i lost my knife. her grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.\"\\n\\n\\n\"who?\" catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. her fingers ached with remembered pain.\\n\\n\\n\"the imp,\" said littlefinger as lord varys watched her face. \"tyrion lannister.\"\\n\\njon\\n\\n\\nthe courtyard rang to the song of swords.\\n\\n\\nunder black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down ', \"jon's chest as he pressed the attack. grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. when he raised his sword, jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy's leg and sent him staggering. grenn's downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. when he tried a sideswing, jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow. jon knocked his sword from his fingers wit\", 'h a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain.\\n\\n\\n\"enough!\" ser alliser thorne had a voice with an edge like valyrian steel.\\n\\n\\ngrenn cradled his hand. \"the bastard broke my wrist.\"\\n\\n\\n\"the bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. or would have, if these blades had an edge. it\\'s fortunate for you that the watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.\" ser alliser gestured at jeren and toad. \"get the aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.\"\\n\\n\\njon took', ' off his helm as the other boys were pulling grenn to his feet. the frosty morning air felt good on his face. he leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.\\n\\n\\n\"that is a longsword, not an old man\\'s cane,\" ser alliser said sharply. \"are your legs hurting, lord snow?\"\\n\\n\\njon hated that name, a mockery that ser alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. the boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. he slid the longsword bac', 'k into its scabbard. \"no,\" he replied.\\n\\n\\nthorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. he was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx. \"the truth now,\" he commanded.\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'m tired,\" jon admitted. his arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done.\\n\\n\\n\"what you are is weak.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i won.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no. the aurochs lost.\"\\n\\n\\none of the other boys snigg', 'ered. jon knew better than to reply. he had beaten everyone that ser alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. the master-at-arms served up only derision. thorne hated him, jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.\\n\\n\\n\"that will be all,\" thorne told them. \"i can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. if the others ever come for us, i pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.\"\\n\\n\\njon followed the rest back to th', \"e armory, walking alone. he often walked alone here. there were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter robb had been at fourteen. dareon was quick but afraid of being hit. pyp used his sword like a dagger, jeren was weak as a girl, grenn slow and clumsy. halder's blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. the more time he spent with them, the more jon despised them\", '.\\n\\n\\ninside, jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him. methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but jon found himself shivering. the chill was always with him here. in a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm.\\n\\n\\nthe weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear. he sat on a ', \"bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak. so cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man's body. there was scant warmth to be found in castle black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.\\n\\n\\nno one had told him the night's watch would be like this; no one except tyrion lannister. the dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. jon wondered if his\", ' father had known what the wall would be like. he must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.\\n\\n\\neven his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. up here, the genial benjen stark he had known became a different person. he was first ranger, and he spent his days and nights with lord commander mormont and maester aemon and the other high officers, while jon was given over to the less than tender charge of ser alliser thorne.\\n\\n\\nthree days after their arrival,', ' jon had heard that benjen stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest. that night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him. benjen refused him curtly. \"this is not winterfell,\" he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger. \"on the wall, a man gets only what he earns. you\\'re no ranger, jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.\"\\n\\n\\nstupidly, jon argued. \"i\\'ll be fifteen on my name day,\" he said. \"almo', 'st a man grown.\"\\n\\n\\nbenjen stark frowned. \"a boy you are, and a boy you\\'ll remain until ser alliser says you are fit to be a man of the night\\'s watch. if you thought your stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. we put aside our old families when we swear our vows. your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now.\" he gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black.\\n\\n\\njon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leav', 'e. one of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. ben stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew. \"how often must i tell you no, jon? we\\'ll speak when i return.\"\\n\\n\\nas he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, jon had remembered the things that tyrion lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind\\'s eye he saw ben stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. the thought made him sick. what', ' was he becoming?\\n\\n\\nafterward he sought out ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur.\\n\\n\\nif he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. castle black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new. if they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.\\n\\n\\nhe missed his true brothers: little rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; robb, his riva', 'l and best friend and constant companion; bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever jon and robb were doing. he missed the girls too, even sansa, who never called him anything but \"my half brother\" since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. and arya . . . he missed her even more than robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had . . .', ' yet she could always make jon smile. he would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.\\n\\n\\n\"you broke my wrist, bastard boy.\"\\n\\n\\njon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three of his friends behind him. he knew todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. the recruits all called him toad. the other two were the ones yoren had brought north with ', 'them, jon remembered, rapers taken down in the fingers. he\\'d forgotten their names. he hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it. they were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them.\\n\\n\\njon stood up. \"i\\'ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.\" grenn was sixteen and a head taller than jon. all four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. he\\'d beaten every one of them in the yard.\\n\\n\\n\"maybe we\\'ll break you,\" one of the rapers said.\\n\\n\\n\"try.\" jon r', 'eached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back.\\n\\n\\n\"you make us look bad,\" complained toad.\\n\\n\\n\"you looked bad before i ever met you,\" jon told him. the boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard. pain lanced through him, but jon would not cry out.\\n\\n\\ntoad stepped close. \"the little lordling has a mouth on him,\" he said. he had pig eyes, small and shiny. \"is that your mommy\\'s mouth, bastard? what was she, some whore? tell us her name. maybe i had her a', ' time or two.\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\njon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him. there was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free. he flew at toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.\\n\\n\\nthe two from the fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. grenn began to kick at him. jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the g', 'loom of the armory. \"stop this! now!\"\\n\\n\\njon pulled himself to his feet. donal noye stood glowering at them. \"the yard is for fighting,\" the armorer said. \"keep your quarrels out of my armory, or i\\'ll make them my quarrels. you won\\'t like that.\"\\n\\n\\ntoad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. his fingers came away bloody. \"he tried to kill me.\"\\n\\n\\n\" \\'s true. i saw it,\" one of the rapers put in.\\n\\n\\n\"he broke my wrist,\" grenn said again, holding it out to noye for inspection.\\n\\n\\nthe ar', 'morer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. \"a bruise. perhaps a sprain. maester aemon will give you a salve. go with him, todder, that head wants looking after. the rest of you, return to your cells. not you, snow. you stay.\"\\n\\n\\njon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution. his arm was throbbing.\\n\\n\\n\"the watch has need of every man it can get,\" donal noye said when they were alone. \"even men ', 'like toad. you won\\'t win any honors killing him.\"\\n\\n\\njon\\'s anger flared. \"he said my mother was - \"\\n\\n\\n\" - a whore. i heard him. what of it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"lord eddard stark was not a man to sleep with whores,\" jon said icily. \"his honor - \"\\n\\n\\n\" - did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. did it?\"\\n\\n\\njon was cold with rage. \"can i go?\"\\n\\n\\n\"you go when i tell you to go.\"\\n\\n\\njon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around. \"l', 'ook at me when i\\'m talking to you, boy.\"\\n\\n\\njon looked. the armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. his nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave. the left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword. \"words won\\'t make your mother a whore. she was what she was, and nothing toad says can change that. you know, we have men on the wall whose mothers were whores.\"\\n\\n\\nnot my mother, jon thought stubbo', 'rnly. he knew nothing of his mother; eddard stark would not talk of her. yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. in his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind.\\n\\n\\n\"you think you had it hard, being a high lord\\'s bastard?\" the armorer went on. \"that boy jeren is a septon\\'s get, and cotter pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. now he commands eastwatch by the sea.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care,\" jon said. \"i don\\'t care about them and i don\\'t care', ' about you or thorne or benjen stark or any of it. i hate it here. it\\'s too . . . it\\'s cold.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes. cold and hard and mean, that\\'s the wall, and the men who walk it. not like the stories your wet nurse told you. well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. this is the way it is, and you\\'re here for life, same as the rest of us.\"\\n\\n\\n\"life,\" jon repeated bitterly. the armorer could talk about life. he\\'d had one. he\\'d only taken the black after he\\'d lost an arm at the siege of storm\\'s end', \". before that he'd smithed for stannis baratheon, the king's brother. he'd seen the seven kingdoms from one end to the other; he'd feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles. they said it was donal noye who'd forged king robert's warhammer, the one that crushed the life from rhaegar targaryen on the trident. he'd done all the things that jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he'd taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm h\", 'ad to come off. only then, crippled, had donal noye come to the wall, when his life was all but over.\\n\\n\"yes, life,\" noye said. \"a long life or a short one, it\\'s up to you, snow. the road you\\'re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.\"\\n\\n\\n\"they\\'re not my brothers,\" jon snapped. \"they hate me because i\\'m better than they are.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no. they hate you because you act like you\\'re better than they are. they look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he\\'s a lordlin', 'g.\" the armorer leaned close. \"you\\'re no lordling. remember that. you\\'re a snow, not a stark. you\\'re a bastard and a bully.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a bully?\" jon almost choked on the word. the accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. \"they were the ones who came after me. four of them.\"\\n\\n\\n\"four that you\\'ve humiliated in the yard. four who are probably afraid of you. i\\'ve watched you fight. it\\'s not training with you. put a good edge on your sword, and they\\'d be dead meat; you know it, i know it, they know ', 'it. you leave them nothing. you shame them. does that make you proud?\"\\n\\n\\njon hesitated. he did feel proud when he won. why shouldn\\'t he? but the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. \"they\\'re all older than me,\" he said defensively.\\n\\n\\n\"older and bigger and stronger, that\\'s the truth . i\\'ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at winterfell, though. who was he, some old knight?\"\\n\\n\\n\"ser rodrik cassel,\" jon said warily. there ', 'was a trap here. he felt it closing around him.\\n\\n\\ndonal noye leaned forward, into jon\\'s face. \"now think on this, boy. none of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until ser alliser. their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. what they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of oldtown and lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. they may have clacked a few sticks together before they came h', 'ere, but i promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.\" his look was grim. \"so how do you like the taste of your victories now, lord snow?\"\\n\\n\\n\"don\\'t call me that!\" jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty. \"i never . . . i didn\\'t think . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"best you start thinking,\" noye warned him. \"that, or sleep with a dagger by your bed. now go.\"\\n\\n\\nby the time jon left the armory, it was almost midday. the sun had broken', ' through the clouds. he turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight. even after all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers. centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky . . . but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky.\\n\\n\\nthe largest structu', 're ever built by the hands of man, benjen stark had told jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the wall in the distance. \"and beyond a doubt the most useless,\" tyrion lannister had added with a grin, but even the imp grew silent as they rode closer. you could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken. this is the end of the world, it seemed to say.\\n\\n\\nwhen the', \"y finally spied castle black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice. the ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no winterfell, no true castle at all. lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the night's watch, and to the north loomed the wall. almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of \", \"the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered. his uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast. the gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.\\n\\n\\nas he stood outside the armory looking up, jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad, when he'd seen it for the first time. the wall was like that. sometimes he co\", 'uld almost forget that it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world. it was older than the seven kingdoms, and when he stood beneath it and looked up, it made jon dizzy. he could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow jon knew that if it fell, the world fell with it.\\n\\n\\n\"makes you wonder what lies beyond,\" a familiar voice sa', 'id.\\n\\n\\njon looked around. \"lannister. i didn\\'t see - i mean, i thought i was alone.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear. \"there\\'s much to be said for taking people unawares. you never know what you might learn.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you won\\'t learn anything from me,\" jon told him. he had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended. as the queen\\'s own brother, tyrion lannister had been an honored guest of the night\\'s watch. the lord commander had given him room', 's in the king\\'s tower - so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years - and lannister dined at mormont\\'s own table and spent his days riding the wall and his nights dicing and drinking with ser alliser and bowen marsh and the other high officers.\\n\\n\\n\"oh, i learn things everywhere i go.\" the little man gestured up at the wall with a gnarled black walking stick. \"as i was saying . . . why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what\\'s on the othe', 'r side?\" he cocked his head and looked at jon with his curious mismatched eyes. \"you do want to know what\\'s on the other side, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s nothing special,\" jon said. he wanted to ride with benjen stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight mance rayder\\'s wildlings and ward the realm against the others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted. \"the rangers say it\\'s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and i', 'ce.\"\\n\\n\\n\"and the grumkins and the snarks,\" tyrion said. \"let us not forget them, lord snow, or else what\\'s that big thing for?\"\\n\\n\\n\"don\\'t call me lord snow.\"\\n\\n\\nthe dwarf lifted an eyebrow. \"would you rather be called the imp? let them see that their words can cut you, and you\\'ll never be free of the mockery. if they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. then they can\\'t hurt you with it anymore.\" he gestured with his stick. \"come, walk with me. they\\'ll be serving some vile stew in the', ' common hall by now, and i could do with a bowl of something hot.\"\\n\\n\\njon was hungry too, so he fell in beside lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf\\'s awkward, waddling steps. the wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten. once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them.\\n\\n\\n\"i don\\'t see your wolf,\" lannister said as they walked.\\n\\n\\n\"i c', 'hain him up in the old stables when we\\'re training. they board all the horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him. the rest of the time he stays with me. my sleeping cell is in hardin\\'s tower.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that\\'s the one with the broken battlement, no? shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like our noble king robert after a long night\\'s drinking? i thought all those buildings had been abandoned.\"\\n\\n\\njon shrugged. \"no one cares where you sleep. most of the old keeps are empty, you ', 'can pick any cell you want.\" once castle black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons. now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister\\'s laughter steamed in the cold air. \"i\\'ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.\"\\n\\n\\njon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. the watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the wall, but ', 'only three were still occupied: eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the shadowtower hard by the mountains where the wall ended, and castle black between them, at the end of the kingsroad. the other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets.\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s better that i\\'m by myself,\" jon said stubbornly. \"the rest of them are scared of ghost.\"\\n\\n\\n\"wise boys,\" lannister said. then he changed the sub', 'ject. \"the talk is, your uncle is too long away.\"\\n\\n\\njon remembered the wish he\\'d wished in his anger, the vision of benjen stark dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly. the dwarf had a way of sensing things, and jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes. \"he said he\\'d be back by my name day,\" he admitted. his name day had come and gone, unremarked, a fortnight past. \"they were looking for ser waymar royce, his father is bannerman to lord arryn. uncle benjen said they might search a', 's far as the shadowtower. that\\'s all the way up in the mountains.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,\" lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall. he grinned and pulled open the door. \"perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.\"\\n\\n\\ninside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth. crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling. jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from ', 'the day\\'s cooks. grenn and toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices. jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment. then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners.\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. \"barley, onion, carrot,\" he muttered. \"someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn\\'t a meat.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it\\'s mutton stew.\" jon pulled off his gloves and warme', 'd his hands in the steam rising from the bowl. the smell made his mouth water.\\n\\n\\n\"snow.\"\\n\\n\\njon knew alliser thorne\\'s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before. he turned.\\n\\n\\n\"the lord commander wants to see you. now.\"\\n\\n\\nfor a moment jon was too frightened to move. why would the lord commander want to see him? they had heard something about benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. \"is it my uncle?\" he blurted. \"is he returned safe?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the lord', ' commander is not accustomed to waiting,\" was ser alliser\\'s reply. \"and i am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister swung off the bench and rose. \"stop it, thorne. you\\'re frightening the boy.\"\\n\\n\\n\"keep out of matters that don\\'t concern you, lannister. you have no place here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i have a place at court, though,\" the dwarf said, smiling. \"a word in the right ear, and you\\'ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train. now tell snow why the old b', 'ear needs to see him. is there news of his uncle?\"\\n\\n\\n\"no,\" ser alliser said. \"this is another matter entirely. a bird arrived this morning from winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother.\" he corrected himself. \"his half brother.\"\\n\\n\\n\"bran,\" jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. \"something\\'s happened to bran.\"\\n\\n\\ntyrion lannister laid a hand on his arm. \"jon,\" he said. \"i am truly sorry.\"\\n\\n\\njon scarcely heard him. he brushed off tyrion\\'s hand and strode across the hall. he was running by', ' the time he hit the doors. he raced to the commander\\'s keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. when the guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time. by the time he burst into the presence of the lord commander, his boots were soaked and jon was wild-eyed and panting. \"bran,\" he said. \"what does it say about bran?\"\\n\\n\\njeor mormont, lord commander of the night\\'s watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard. he had a raven on his arm, and he was feedin', 'g it kernels of corn. \"i am told you can read.\" he shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat watching as mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to jon. \"corn,\" it muttered in a raucous voice. \"corn, corn.\"\\n\\n\\njon\\'s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat. he recognized robb\\'s hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them. he realized he was crying. and then, through the tears, ', 'he found the sense in the words, and raised his head. \"he woke up,\" he said. \"the gods gave him back.\"\\n\\n\\n\"crippled,\" mormont said. \"i\\'m sorry, boy. read the rest of the letter.\"\\n\\n\\nhe looked at the words, but they didn\\'t matter. nothing mattered. bran was going to live. \"my brother is going to live,\" he told mormont. the lord commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled. the raven flew to his shoulder, crying, \"live! live!\"\\n\\n\\njon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face a', 'nd robb\\'s letter in his hand. \"my brother is going to live,\" he told the guards. they exchanged a look. he ran back to the common hall, where he found tyrion lannister just finishing his meal. he grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and spun him around in a circle. \"bran is going to live!\" he whooped. lannister looked startled. jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands. \"here, read it,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nothers were gathering around and looking at him curiously. ', 'jon noticed grenn a few feet away. a thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand. he looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at all. jon went to him. grenn edged backward and put up his hands. \"stay away from me now, you bastard.\"\\n\\n\\njon smiled at him. \"i\\'m sorry about your wrist. robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade. it hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse. look, if you want, i can show you how to defend that.\"\\n\\n\\nalliser thorne overheard him. \"lord s', 'now wants to take my place now.\" he sneered. \"i\\'d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i\\'ll take that wager, ser alliser,\" jon said. \"i\\'d love to see ghost juggle.\"\\n\\n\\njon heard grenn suck in his breath, shocked. silence fell.\\n\\n\\nthen tyrion lannister guffawed. three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table. the laughter spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in. the birds stirred in the rafters, and finally even gre', 'nn began to chuckle.\\n\\nser alliser never took his eyes from jon. as the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his sword hand curled into a fist. \"that was a grievous error, lord snow,\" he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy. \\n\\neddard\\n\\n\\neddard stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the red keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. he was still ahorse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king\\'s steward told him that grand maester pycelle', ' had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. the honor of the hand\\'s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. \"it will be convenient on the morrow,\" ned snapped as he dismounted.\\n\\n\\nthe steward bowed very low. \"i shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.\"\\n\\n\\n\"no, damn it,\" ned said. it would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. \"i will see them. pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.\"\\n\\n\\n\"yes, my lord,\" the steward said. ', '\"we have given you lord arryn\\'s former chambers in the tower of the hand, if it please you. i shall have your things taken there.\"\\n\\n\\n\"my thanks,\" ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. the rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him. ned saw vayon poole, his own steward, and called out. \"it seems the council has urgent need of me. see that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell jory to keep them there. arya is not to go exploring.\" pool', 'e bowed. ned turned back to the royal steward. \"my wagons are still straggling through the city. i shall need appropriate garments.\"\\n\\n\\n\"it will be my great pleasure,\" the steward said.\\n\\n\\nand so ned had come striding into the council chambers, bone-tired and dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for him.\\n\\n\\nthe chamber was richly furnished. myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright pa', 'ints on a carved screen from the summer isles. the walls were hung with tapestries from norvos and qohor and lys, and a pair of valyrian sphinxes flanked the door, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces.\\n\\n\\nthe councillor ned liked least, the eunuch varys, accosted him the moment he entered. \"lord stark, i was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. we have all been visiting the sept to light candles for prince joffrey. i pray for his recovery.\" his hand left ', 'powder stains on ned\\'s sleeve, and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave.\\n\\n\\n\"your gods have heard you,\" ned replied, cool yet polite. \"the prince grows stronger every day.\" he disentangled himself from the eunuch\\'s grip and crossed the room to where lord renly stood by the screen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be littlefinger. renly had been a boy of eight when robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that ned found it disconcerting. w', 'henever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and robert stood before him, fresh from his victory on the trident.\\n\\n\\n\"i see you have arrived safely, lord stark,\" renly said.\\n\\n\\n\"and you as well,\" ned replied. \"you must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother robert.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a poor copy,\" renly said with a shrug.\\n\\n\\n\"though much better dressed,\" littlefinger quipped. \"lord renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court.\"\\n\\n\\nit was true enough. lord', ' renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet. a cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald brooch. \"there are worse crimes,\" renly said with a laugh. \"the way you dress, for one.\"\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger ignored the jibe. he eyed ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. \"i have hoped to meet you for some years, lord stark. no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"she has,\" ned replied with a ', 'chill in his voice. the sly arrogance of the comment rankled him. \"i understand you knew my brother brandon as well.\"\\n\\n\\nrenly baratheon laughed. varys shuffled over to listen.\\n\\n\\n\"rather too well,\" littlefinger said. \"i still carry a token of his esteem. did brandon speak of me too?\"\\n\\n\\n\"often, and with some heat,\" ned said, hoping that would end it. he had no patience with this game they played, this dueling with words.\\n\\n\\n\"i should have thought that heat ill suits you starks,\" littlefinger said. ', '\"here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the neck.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i do not plan on melting soon, lord baelish. you may count on it.\" ned moved to the council table and said, \"maester pycelle, i trust you are well.\"\\n\\n\\nthe grand maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. \"well enough for a man of my years, my lord,\" he replied, \"yet i do tire easily, i fear.\" wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kind', 'ly face. his maester\\'s collar was no simple metal choker such as luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast. the links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. \"perhaps we might begin soon,\" the grand ', 'maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. \"i fear i shall fall asleep if we wait much longer.\"\\n\\n\\n\"as you will.\" the king\\'s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. \"my lords,\" he said formally, \"i am sorry to have kept you waiting.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you are the king\\'s hand,\" varys said. \"we serve at your pleasure, lord stark.\"\\n\\n\\nas the others took their accu', 'stomed seats, it struck eddard stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with these men. he remembered what robert had told him in the crypts below winterfell. i am surrounded by flatterers and fools, the king had insisted. ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. he thought he knew already. \"we are but five,\" he pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\"lord stannis took himself to dragonstone not long after the king went north,\" varys said, \"and our', ' gallant ser barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the lord commander of the kingsguard.\"\\n\\n\\n\"perhaps we had best wait for ser barristan and the king to join us,\" ned suggested.\\n\\n\\nrenly baratheon laughed aloud. \"if we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.\"\\n\\n\\n\"our good king robert has many cares,\" varys said. \"he entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten his load.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what lord varys means is that all', ' this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears,\" lord renly said, \"so it falls to us to govern the realm. he does send us a command from time to time.\" he drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. \"this morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask grand maester pycelle to convene this council at once. he has an urgent task for us.\"\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger smiled and handed the paper to ned. it bore the royal seal. ned broke the wax', ' with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king\\'s urgent command, reading the words with mounting disbelief. was there no end to robert\\'s folly? and to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound. \"gods be good,\" he swore.\\n\\n\\n\"what lord eddard means to say,\" lord renly announced, \"is that his grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the hand of the king.\"\\n\\n\\n\"how much?\" asked littlefinger, mildly.\\n\\n\\nned read the answer off the letter. \"forty t', 'housand golden dragons to the champion. twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition.\"\\n\\n\\n\"ninety thousand gold pieces,\" littlefinger sighed. \"and we must not neglect the other costs. robert will want a prodigious feast. that means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"fools we have in plenty,\" lord renly said.\\n\\n\\ngrand maester pycelle looked to littlefinger and aske', 'd, \"will the treasury bear the expense?\"\\n\\n\\n\"what treasury is that?\" littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. \"spare me the foolishness, maester. you know as well as i that the treasury has been empty for years. i shall have to borrow the money. no doubt the lannisters will be accommodating. we owe lord tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?\"\\n\\n\\nned was stunned. \"are you claiming that the crown is three million gold pieces in debt?\"\\n\\n\\n\"the crown i', 's more than six million gold pieces in debt, lord stark. the lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from lord tyrell, the iron bank of braavos, and several tyroshi trading cartels. of late i\\'ve had to turn to the faith. the high septon haggles worse than a dornish fishmonger.\"\\n\\n\\nned was aghast. \"aerys targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. how could you let this happen?\"\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger gave a shrug. \"the master of coin finds the money. the king and the hand spend ', 'it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i will not believe that jon arryn allowed robert to beggar the realm,\" ned said hotly.\\n\\n\\ngrand maester pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. \"lord arryn was a prudent man, but i fear that his grace does not always listen to wise counsel.\"\\n\\n\\n\"my royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,\" renly baratheon said, \"and he loathes what he calls \\'counting coppers.\\' \"\\n\\n\\n\"i will speak with his grace,\" ned said. \"this tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.\"\\n\\n', '\\n\"speak to him as you will,\" lord renly said, \"we had still best make our plans.\"\\n\\n\\n\"another day,\" ned said. perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. he would have to remember that he was no longer in winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first among equals. \"forgive me, my lords,\" he said in a softer tone. \"i am tired. let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher.\" he did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, and mad', 'e for the door.\\n\\n\\noutside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men. the king had not yet arrived, he was told. since the ugliness on the trident, the starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate themselves from the lannisters and the growing tension. robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. if so, he', \" might be hours behind, but he would still be here too soon for ned's liking. he had only to look at sansa's face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again. the last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. sansa blamed arya and told her that it should have been nymeria who died. and arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher's boy. sansa cried herself to sleep, arya brooded silently all day long, and eddard stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the starks of\", ' winterfell.\\n\\n\\nhe crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what he thought was the tower of the hand when littlefinger appeared in front of him. \"you\\'re going the wrong way, stark. come with me.\"\\n\\n\\nhesitantly, ned followed. littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. they were relics of the targaryens, black steel wi', 'th dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and forgotten. \"this is not the way to my chambers,\" ned said.\\n\\n\\n\"did i say it was? i\\'m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall,\" littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"we have no time for this, stark. your wife awaits.\"\\n\\n\\n\"what game are you playing, littlefinger? catelyn is at winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh?\" littlefinger\\'s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. ', '\"then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation. for the last time, come. or don\\'t come, and i\\'ll keep her for myself.\" he hurried down the steps.\\n\\n\\nned followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. he had no taste for these intrigues, but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like littlefinger.\\n\\n\\nat the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. petyr baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured ned through. they stepped out into t', 'he ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. \"we\\'re outside the castle,\" ned said.\\n\\n\\n\"you are a hard man to fool, stark,\" littlefinger said with a smirk. \"was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky? follow me. there are niches cut in the rock. try not to fall to your death, catelyn would never understand .\" with that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey.\\n\\n\\nned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more slowly. the niches', ' were there, as littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where to look for them. the river was a long, dizzying distance below. ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to.\\n\\n\\nwhen at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water\\'s edge, littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple. he was almost down to the core. \"you are growing old and slow, stark,\" he sa', 'id, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water. \"no matter, we ride the rest of the way.\" he had two horses waiting. ned mounted up and trotted behind him, down the trail and into the city.\\n\\n\\nfinally baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk. the sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water. beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of l', 'eaded red glass.\\n\\n\\nned stark dismounted in a fury. \"a brothel,\" he said as he seized littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around. \"you\\'ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.\"\\n\\n\\n\"your wife is inside,\" littlefinger said.\\n\\n\\nit was the final insult. \"brandon was too kind to you,\" ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard.\\n\\n\"my lord, no,\" an urgent voice called out. \"he speaks the truth.\" there were footstep', 's behind him.\\n\\n\\nned spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. he was dressed in brown roughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. \"this is no business of yours,\" ned began; then, suddenly, the recognition came. he lowered the dagger, astonished. \"ser rodrik?\"\\n\\n\\nrodrik cassel nodded. \"your lady awaits you upstairs.\"\\n\\n\\nned was lost. \"catelyn is truly here? this is not some strange jape of littlefinger\\'s?\" he sheathed his blade.\\n\\n\\n\"would that it were, ', 'stark,\" littlefinger said. \"follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the king\\'s hand. it would not do to have you recognized. perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing.\"\\n\\n\\nthey went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps. no one paid ned the least bit of attention. ser rodrik wa', 'ited below while littlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door.\\n\\n\\ninside, catelyn was waiting. she cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely.\\n\\n\\n\"my lady,\" ned whispered in wonderment.\\n\\n\\n\"oh, very good,\" said littlefinger, closing the door. \"you recognized her.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i feared you\\'d never come, my lord,\" she whispered against his chest. \"petyr has been bringing me reports. he told me of your troubles with arya and the young prince. how are m', 'y girls?\"\\n\\n\\n\"both in mourning, and full of anger,\" he told her. \"cat, i do not understand. what are you doing in king\\'s landing? what\\'s happened?\" ned asked his wife. \"is it bran? is he . . . \"dead was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it.\\n\\n\\n\"it is bran, but not as you think,\" catelyn said.\\n\\n\\nned was lost. \"then how? why are you here, my love? what is this place?\"\\n\\n\\n\"just what it appears,\" littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. \"a brothel. can you think of a les', 's likely place to find a catelyn tully?\" he smiled. \"as it chances, i own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made. i am most anxious to keep the lannisters from learning that cat is here in king\\'s landing.\"\\n\\n\\n\"why?\" ned asked. he saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left. \"you\\'ve been hurt.\" he took her hands in his own, turned them over. \"gods. those are deep cuts . . . a gash from a sword or .', ' . . how did this happen, my lady?\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. \"this blade was sent to open bran\\'s throat and spill his life\\'s blood.\"\\n\\n\\nned\\'s head jerked up. \"but . . . who . . . why would . . . \"\\n\\n\\nshe put a finger to his lips. \"let me tell it all, my love. it will go faster that way. listen.\"\\n\\n\\nso he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to varys and the guardsmen and littlefinger. and when she was done, eddard stark', ' sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. bran\\'s wolf had saved the boy\\'s life, he thought dully. what was it that jon had said when they found the pups in the snow? your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. and he had killed sansa\\'s, and for what? was it guilt he was feeling? or fear? if the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he done?\\n\\n\\npainfully, ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. \"the imp\\'s dagger,\" he repeated. it made no sense. his h', 'and curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the blade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. it stood mocking him. \"why should tyrion lannister want bran dead? the boy has never done him harm.\"\\n\\n\\n\"do you starks have nought but snow between your ears?\" littlefinger asked. \"the imp would never have acted alone.\"\\n\\n\\nned rose and paced the length of the room. \"if the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself . . . no, i will not believe that.\" yet even as he sai', 'd the words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and robert\\'s talk of sending hired knives after the targaryen princess. he remembered rhaegar\\'s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king had turned away, as he had turned away in darry\\'s audience hall not so long ago. he could still hear sansa pleading, as lyanna had pleaded once.\\n\\n\\n\"most likely the king did not know,\" littlefinger said. \"it would not be the first time. our good robert is practiced at closing hi', 's eyes to things he would rather not see.\"\\n\\n\\nned had no reply for that. the face of the butcher\\'s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said not a word. his head was pounding.\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. \"the accusation is treason either way. accuse the king and you will dance with ilyn payne before the words are out of your mouth. the queen . . . if you can find proof, and if you can make robert listen, th', 'en perhaps . . . \"\\n\\n\\n\"we have proof,\" ned said. \"we have the dagger.\"\\n\\n\\n\"this?\" littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. \"a sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord. the imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?\" he tossed the knife lightly to ned. \"my counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.\"\\n\\n\\nned regarded him coldly. \"lord baelish, i am a', ' stark of winterfell. my son lies crippled, perhaps dying. he would be dead, and catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow. if you truly believe i could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a fool i may be, stark . . . yet i\\'m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now. if you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but i would rather not be inc', 'luded in the party, thank you very much.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you would be the last man i would willingly include in any party, lord baelish.\"\\n\\n\\n\"you wound me deeply.\" littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. \"for my part, i always found you starks a tiresome lot, but cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons i cannot comprehend. i shall try to keep you alive for her sake. a fool\\'s task, admittedly, but i could never refuse your wife anything.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i told petyr our suspicions about jon arryn\\'s death', ',\" catelyn said. \"he has promised to help you find the truth.\"\\n\\n\\nthat was not news that eddard stark welcomed, but it was true enough that they needed help, and littlefinger had been almost a brother to cat once. it would not be the first time that ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised. \"very well,\" he said, thrusting the dagger into his belt. \"you spoke of varys. does the eunuch know all of it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"not from my lips,\" catelyn said. \"you did not wed a fool, eddard stark.', ' but varys has ways of learning things that no man could know. he has some dark art, ned, i swear it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he has spies, that is well known,\" ned said, dismissive.\\n\\n\\n\"it is more than that,\" catelyn insisted. \"ser rodrik spoke to ser aron santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the spider knew of their conversation. i fear that man.\"\\n\\n\\nlittlefinger smiled. \"leave lord varys to me, sweet lady. if you will permit me a small obscenity - and where better for it - i hold the man\\'s balls in the palm of my ', 'hand.\" he cupped his fingers, smiling. \"or would, if he were a man, or had any balls. you see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and varys would not like that. were i you, i would worry more about the lannisters and less about the eunuch.\"\\n\\n\\nned did not need littlefinger to tell him that. he was thinking back to the day arya had been found, to the look on the queen\\'s face when she said, we have a wolf, so soft and quiet. he was thinking of the boy mycah, of jon arryn\\'s sudden death,', ' of bran\\'s fall, of old mad aerys targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life\\'s blood dried on a golden blade. \"my lady,\" he said, turning to catelyn, \"there is nothing more you can do here. i want you to return to winterfell at once. if there was one assassin, there could be others. whoever ordered bran\\'s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives.\"\\n\\n\\n\"i had hoped to see the girls . . . \" catelyn said.\\n\\n\\n\"that would be most unwise,\" littlefinger put in. \"the red ke', 'ep is full of curious eyes, and children talk.\"\\n\\n\\n\"he speaks truly, my love,\" ned told her. he embraced her. \"take ser rodrik and ride for winterfell. i will watch over the girls. go home to our sons and keep them safe.\"\\n\\n\\n\"as you say, my lord.\" catelyn lifted her face, and ned kissed her. her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength, as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms.\\n\\n\\n\"would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?\" asked littlefinger. ', '\"i should warn you, stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.\"\\n\\n\\n\"a moment alone, that\\'s all i ask,\" catelyn said.\\n\\n\\n\"very well.\" littlefinger strolled to the door. \"don\\'t be too long. it is past time the hand and i returned to the castle, before our absence is noted.\"\\n\\n\\ncatelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. \"i will not forget the help you gave me, petyr. when your men came for me, i did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. i have found yo', 'u more than a friend. i have found a brother i\\'d thought lost.\"\\n\\n\\npetyr baelish smiled. \"i am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. best not tell anyone. i have spent years convincing the court that i am wicked and cruel, and i should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.\"\\n\\n\\nned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, \"you have my thanks as well, lord baelish.\"\\n\\n\\n\"oh, now there\\'s a treasure,\" littlefinger said, exiting.\\n\\n\\nwhen the door had closed behind him, ', 'ned turned back to his wife. \"once you are home, send word to helman tallhart and galbart glover under my seal. they are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify moat cailin. two hundred determined archers can hold the neck against an army. instruct lord manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at whiteharbor, and see that they are well manned. and from this day on, i want a careful watch kept over theon greyjoy. if there is war, we shall have sore need of his father\\'s fle', 'et.\"\\n\\n\\n\"war?\" the fear was plain on catelyn\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n\"it will not come to that,\" ned promised her, praying it was true. he took her in his arms again. \"the lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as aerys targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have. i must play out this fool\\'s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. remember why i came here, my love. if i find proof that the lannister', 's murdered jon arryn . . . \"\\n\\n\\nhe felt catelyn tremble in his arms. her scarred hands clung to him. \"if,\" she said, \"what then, my love?\"\\n\\n\\nthat was the most dangerous part, ned knew. \"all justice flows from the king,\" he told her. \"when i know the truth, i must go to robert.\" and pray that he is the man i think he is, he finished silently, and not the man i fear he has become.']\n"
